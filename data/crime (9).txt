	Clemenza	finally	narrowed	down	the	list	of	candidates	to	three	men. The	first	was	an	enforcer	who	worked	with	the	colored	policy	bankers	in Harlem,	a	big	brawny	brute	of	a	man	of	great	physical	strength,	a	man	with	a great	deal	of	personal	charm	who	could	get	along	with	people	and	yet	when necessary	make	them	go	in	fear	of	him.	But	Clemenza	scratched	him	off	the	list after	considering	his	name	for	a	half	hour.	This	man	got	along	too	well	with	the black	people,	which	hinted	at	some	flaw	of	character.	Also	he	would	be	too	hard to	replace	in	the	position	he	now	held.
																The	second	name	Clemenza	considered	and	almost	settled	on	was	a hard-working	chap	who	served	faithfully	and	well	in	the	organization.	This	man was	the	collector	of	delinquent	accounts	for	Family-licensed	shylocks	in Manhattan.	He	had	started	off	as	a	bookmaker’s	runner.	But	he	was	not	quite	yet ready	for	such	an	important	promotion.
																Finally	he	settled	on	Rocco	Lampone.	Lampone	had	served	a	short	but impressive	apprenticeship	in	the	Family.	During	the	war	he	had	been	wounded in	Africa	and	been	discharged	in	1943.	Because	of	the	shortage	of	young	men, Clemenza	had	taken	him	on	even	though	Lampone	was	partially	incapacitated by	his	injuries	and	walked	with	a	pronounced	limp.	Clemenza	had	used	him	as	a black-market	contact	in	the	garment	center	and	with	government	employees controlling	OP	A	food	stamps.	From	that,	Lampone	had	graduated	to	troubleshooter	for	the	whole	operation.	What	Clemenza	liked	about	him	was	his	good judgment.	He	knew	that	there	was	no	percentage	in	being	tough	about	something that	would	only	cost	a	heavy	fine	or	six	months	in	jail,	small	prices	to	pay	for	the enormous	profits	earned.	He	had	the	good	sense	to	know	that	it	was	not	an	area for	heavy	threats	but	light	ones.	He	kept	the	whole	operation	in	a	minor	key, which	was	exactly	what	was	needed.
																Clemenza	felt	the	relief	of	a	conscientious	administrator	who	has solved	a	knotty	personnel	problem.	Yes,	it	would	be	Rocco	Lampone	who	would assist.	For	Clemenza	planned	to	handle	this	job	himself,	not	only	to	help	a	new, inexperienced	man	“make	his	bones,”	but	to	settle	a	personal	score	with	Paulie Gat	to.	Paulie	had	been	his	protégé,	he	had	advanced	Paulie	over	the	heads	of more	deserving	and	more	loyal	people,	he	had	helped	Paulie	“make	his	bones” and	furthered	his	career	in	every	way.	Paulie	had	not	only	betrayed	the	Family,
he	had	betrayed	his	padrone,	Peter	Clemenza.	This	lack	of	respect	had	to	be repaid.
																Everything	else	was	arranged.	Paulie	Gatto	had	been	instructed	to	pick him	up	at	three	in	the	afternoon,	and	to	pick	him	up	with	his	own	car,	nothing hot.	Now	Clemenza	took	up	the	telephone	and	dialed	Rocco	Lampone’s	number. He	did	not	identify	himself.	He	simply	said,	“Come	to	my	house,	I	have	an errand	for	you.”	He	was	pleased	to	note	that	despite	the	early	hour,	Lampone’s voice	was	not	surprised	or	dazed	with	sleep	and	he	simply	said,	“OK.”	Good man.	Clemenza	added,	“No	rush,	have	your	breakfast	and	lunch	first	before	you come	see	me.	But	not	later	than	two	in	the	afternoon.”
																There	was	another	laconic	OK	on	the	other	end	and	Clemenza	hung	up the	phone.	He	had	already	alerted	his	people	about	replacing	caporegime Tessio’s	people	in	the	Corleone	mall	so	that	was	done.	He	had	capable subordinates	and	never	interfered	in	a	mechanical	operation	of	that	kind.
																He	decided	to	wash	his	Cadillac.	He	loved	the	car.	It	gave	him	such	a quiet	peaceful	ride,	and	its	upholstery	was	so	rich	that	he	sometimes	sat	in	it	for an	hour	when	the	weather	was	good	because	it	was	more	pleasant	than	sitting	in the	house.	And	it	always	helped	him	think	when	he	was	grooming	the	car.	He remembered	his	father	in	Italy	doing	the	same	thing	with	donkeys.
																Clemenza	worked	inside	the	heated	garage,	he	hated	cold.	He	ran	over his	plans.	You	had	to	be	careful	with	Paulie,	the	man	was	like	a	rat,	he	could smell	danger.	And	now	of	course	despite	being	so	tough	he	must	be	shitting	in his	pants	because	the	old	man	was	still	alive.	He’d	be	as	skittish	as	a	donkey with	ants	up	his	ass.	But	Clemenza	was	accustomed	to	these	circumstances, usual	in	his	work.	First,	he	had	to	have	a	good	excuse	for	Rocco	to	accompany them.	Second,	he	had	to	have	a	plausible	mission	for	the	three	of	them	to	go	on.
																Of	course,	strictly	speaking,	this	was	not	necessary.	Paulie	Gatto	could be	killed	without	any	of	these	frills.	He	was	locked	in,	he	could	not	run	away. But	Clemenza	felt	strongly	that	it	was	important	to	keep	good	working	habits and	never	give	away	a	fraction	of	a	percentage	point.	You	never	could	tell	what might	happen	and	these	matters	were,	after	all,	questions	of	life	and	death.
																As	he	washed	his	baby-blue	Cadillac,	Peter	Clemenza	pondered	and rehearsed	his	lines,	the	expressions	of	his	face.	He	would	be	curt	with	Paulie,	as if	displeased	with	him.	With	a	man	so	sensitive	and	suspicious	as	Gatto	this would	throw	him	off	the	track	or	at	least	leave	him	uncertain.	Undue	friendliness would	make	him	wary.	But	of	course	the	curtness	must	not	be	too	angry.	It	had to	be	rather	an	absentminded	sort	of	irritation.	And	why	Lampone?	Paulie	would find	that	most	alarming,	especially	since	Lampone	had	to	be	in	the	rear	seat. Paulie	wouldn’t	like	being	helpless	at	the	wheel	with	Lampone	behind	his	head. Clemenza	rubbed	and	polished	the	metal	of	his	Cadillac	furiously.	It	was	going to	be	tricky.	Very	tricky.	For	a	moment	he	debated	whether	to	recruit	another man	but	decided	against	it.	Here	he	followed	basic	reasoning.	In	years	to	come	a situation	might	arise	where	it	might	be	profitable	for	one	of	his	partners	to	testify against	him.	If	there	were	just	one	accomplice	it	was	one’s	word	against	the other.	But	the	word	of	a	second	accomplice	could	swing	the	balance.	No,	they would	stick	to	procedure.
																What	annoyed	Clemenza	was	that	the	execution	had	to	be	“public.” That	is,	the	body	was	to	be	found.	He	would	have	much	preferred	having	it disappear.	(Usual	burying	grounds	were	the	nearby	ocean	or	the	swamplands	of New	Jersey	on	land	owned	by	friends	of	the	Family	or	by	other	more complicated	methods.)	But	it	had	to	be	public	so	that	embryo	traitors	would	be frightened	and	the	enemy	warned	that	the	Corleone	Family	had	by	no	means gone	stupid	or	soft.	Sollozzo	would	be	made	wary	by	this	quick	discovery	of	his spy.	The	Corleone	Family	would	win	back	some	of	its	prestige.	It	had	been	made to	look	foolish	by	the	shooting	of	the	old	man.
																Clemenza	sighed.	The	Cadillac	gleamed	like	a	huge	blue	steel	egg,	and he	was	nowhere	near	the	solving	of	his	problem.	Then	the	solution	hit	him, logical	and	to	the	point.	It	would	explain	Rocco	Lampone,	himself	and	Paulie being	together	and	give	them	a	mission	of	sufficient	secrecy	and	importance.
																He	would	tell	Paulie	that	their	job	today	was	to	find	an	apartment	in case	the	Family	decided	to	“go	to	the	mattresses.”
																Whenever	a	war	between	the	Families	became	bitterly	intense,	the opponents	would	set	up	headquarters	in	secret	apartments	where	the	“soldiers”
could	sleep	on	mattresses	scattered	through	the	rooms.	This	was	not	so	much	to keep	their	families	out	of	danger,	their	wives	and	little	children,	since	any	attack on	noncombatants	was	undreamed	of.	All	parties	were	too	vulnerable	to	similar retaliation.	But	it	was	always	smarter	to	live	in	some	secret	place	where	your everyday	movements	could	not	be	charted	either	by	your	opponents	or	by	some police	who	might	arbitrarily	decide	to	meddle.
																And	so	usually	a	trusted	caporegime	would	be	sent	out	to	rent	a	secret apartment	and	fill	it	with	mattresses.	That	apartment	would	be	used	as	a	sally port	into	the	city	when	an	offensive	was	mounted.	It	was	natural	for	Clemenza	to be	sent	on	such	an	errand.	It	was	natural	for	him	to	take	Gatto	and	Lampone	with him	to	arrange	all	the	details,	including	the	furnishing	of	the	apartment.	Also, Clemenza	thought	with	a	grin,	Paulie	Gatto	had	proved	he	was	greedy	and	the first	thought	that	would	pop	into	his	head	was	how	much	he	could	get	from Sollozzo	for	this	valuable	intelligence.
																Rocco	Lampone	arrived	early	and	Clemenza	explained	what	had	to	be done	and	what	their	roles	would	be.	Lampone’s	face	lit	up	with	surprised gratitude	and	he	thanked	Clemenza	respectfully	for	the	promotion	allowing	him to	serve	the	Family.	Clemenza	was	sure	he	had	done	well.	He	clapped	Lampone on	the	shoulder	and	said,	“You’ll	get	something	better	for	your	living	after today.	We’ll	talk	about	that	later.	You	understand	the	Family	now	is	occupied with	more	critical	matters,	more	important	things	to	do.”	Lampone	made	a gesture	that	said	he	would	be	patient,	knowing	his	reward	was	certain.
																Clemenza	went	to	his	den’s	safe	and	opened	it.	He	took	out	a	gun	and gave	it	to	Lampone.	“Use	this	one,”	he	said.	“They	can	never	trace	it.	Leave	it	in the	car	with	Paulie.	When	this	job	is	finished	I	want	you	to	take	your	wife	and children	on	a	vacation	to	Florida.	Use	your	own	money	now	and	I’ll	pay	you back	later.	Relax,	get	the	sun.	Use	the	Family	hotel	in	Miami	Beach	so	I’ll	know where	I	can	get	you	when	I	want.”
																Clemenza’s	wife	knocked	on	the	door	of	the	den	to	tell	them	that Paulie	Gatto	had	arrived.	He	was	parked	in	the	driveway.	Clemenza	led	the	way through	the	garage	and	Lampone	followed	him.	When	Clemenza	got	into	the front	seat	with	Gatto	he	merely	grunted	in	greeting,	an	exasperated	look	on	his
face.	He	looked	at	his	wristwatch	as	if	he	expected	to	find	that	Gatto	was	late.
																The	ferret-faced	button	man	was	watching	him	intently,	looking	for	a clue.	He	flinched	a	little	when	Lampone	got	into	the	rear	seat	behind	him	and said,	“Rocco,	sit	on	the	other	side.	A	big	guy	like	you	blocks	up	my	rear-view mirror.”	Lampone	shifted	dutifully	so	that	he	was	sitting	behind	Clemenza,	as	if such	a	request	was	the	most	natural	thing	in	the	world.
																Clemenza	said	sourly	to	Gat	to,	“Damn	that	Sonny,	he’s	running scared.	He’s	already	thinking	of	going	to	the	mattresses.	We	have	to	find	a	place on	the	West	Side.	Paulie,	you	and	Rocco	gotta	staff	and	supply	it	until	the	word comes	down	for	the	rest	of	the	soldiers	to	use	it.	You	know	a	good	location?”
																As	he	had	expected,	Gatto	‘s	eyes	became	greedily	interested.	Paulie had	swallowed	the	bait	and	because	he	was	thinking	how	much	the	information was	worth	to	Sollozzo,	he	was	forgetting	to	think	about	whether	he	was	in danger.	Also,	Lampone	was	acting	his	part	perfectly,	staring	out	the	window	in	a disinterested,	relaxed	way.	Clemenza	congratulated	himself	on	his	choice.
																Gatto	shrugged.	“I’d	have	to	think	about	it,”	he	said.
																Clemenza	grunted.	“Drive	while	you	think,	I	want	to	get	to	New	York today.”
																Paulie	was	an	expert	driver	and	traffic	going	into	the	city	was	light	at this	time	in	the	afternoon,	so	the	early	winter	darkness	was	just	beginning	to	fall when	they	arrived.	There	was	no	small	talk	in	the	car.	Clemenza	directed	Paulie to	drive	up	to	the	Washington	Heights	section.	He	checked	a	few	apartment buildings	and	told	him	to	park	near	Arthur	Avenue	and	wait.	He	also	left	Rocco Lampone	in	the	car.	He	went	into	the	Vera	Mario	Restaurant	and	had	a	light dinner	of	veal	and	salad,	nodding	his	hellos	to	some	acquaintances.	After	an hour	had	gone	by	he	walked	the	several	blocks	to	where	the	car	was	parked	and entered	it.	Gatto	and	Lampone	were	still	waiting.	“Shit,”	Clemenza	said,	“they want	us	back	in	Long	Beach.	They	got	some	other	job	for	us	now.	Sonny	says we	can	let	this	one	go	until	later.	Rocco,	you	live	in	the	city,	can	we	drop	you off?”
																Rocco	said	quietly,	“I	have	my	car	out	at	your	place	and	my	old	lady needs	it	first	thing	in	the	morning.”
																“That’s	right,”	Clemenza	said.	“Then	you	have	to	come	back	with	us, after	all.”
																Again	on	the	ride	back	to	Long	Beach	nothing	was	said.	On	the	stretch of	road	that	led	into	the	city,	Clemenza	said	suddenly,	“Paulie,	pull	over,	I	gotta take	a	leak.”	From	working	together	so	long,	Gatto	knew	the	fat	caporegime	had a	weak	bladder.	He	had	often	made	such	a	request.	Gatto	pulled	the	car	off	the highway	onto	the	soft	earth	that	led	to	the	swamp.	Clemenza	climbed	out	of	the car	and	took	a	few	steps	into	the	bushes.	He	actually	relieved	himself.	Then	as he	opened	the	door	to	get	back	into	the	car	he	took	a	quick	look	up	and	down	the highway.	There	were	no	lights,	the	road	was	completely	dark.	“Go	ahead,” Clemenza	said.	A	second	later	the	interior	of	the	car	reverberated	with	the	report of	a	gun.	Paulie	Gatto	seemed	to	jump	forward,	his	body	flinging	against	the steering	wheel	and	then	slumping	over	to	the	seat.	Clemenza	had	stepped	back hastily	to	avoid	being	hit	with	fragments	of	skull	bone	and	blood.
																Rocco	Lampone	scrambled	out	of	the	back	seat.	He	still	held	the	gun and	he	threw	it	into	the	swamp.	He	and	Clemenza	walked	hastily	to	a	car	parked nearby	and	got	in.	Lampone	reached	underneath	the	seat	and	found	the	key	that had	been	left	for	them.	He	started	the	car	and	drove	Clemenza	to	his	home.	Then instead	of	going	back	by	the	same	route,	he	took	the	Jones	Beach	Causeway right	on	through	to	the	town	of	Merrick	and	onto	the	Meadowbrook	Parkway until	he	reached	the	Northern	State	Parkway.	He	rode	that	to	the	Long	Island Expressway	and	then	continued	on	to	the	Whitestone	Bridge	and	through	the Bronx	to	his	home	in	Manhattan.
	
Chapter	7
	
																On	the	night	before	the	shooting	of	Don	Corleone,	his	strongest	and
most	loyal	and	most	feared	retainer	prepared	to	meet	with	the	enemy.	Luca	Brasi had	made	contact	with	the	forces	of	Sollozzo	several	months	before.	He	had done	so	on	the	orders	of	Don	Corleone	himself.	He	had	done	so	by	frequenting the	nightclubs	controlled	by	the	Tattaglia	Family	and	by	taking	up	with	one	of their	top	call	girls.	In	bed	with	this	call	girl	he	grumbled	about	how	he	was	held down	in	the	Corleone	Family,	how	his	worth	was	not	recognized.	After	a	week of	this	affair	with	the	call	girl,	Luca	was	approached	by	Bruno	Tattaglia, manager	of	the	nightclub.	Bruno	was	the	youngest	son,	and	ostensibly	not connected	with	the	Family	business	of	prostitution.	But	his	famous	nightclub with	its	dancing	line	of	long-stemmed	beauties	was	the	finishing	school	for many	of	the	city	hookers.
																The	first	meeting	was	all	above-board,	Tattaglia	offering	him	a	job	to work	in	the	Family	business	as	enforcer.	The	flirtation	went	on	for	nearly	a month.	Luca	played	his	role	of	man	infatuated	with	a	young	beautiful	girl,	Bruno Tattaglia	the	role	of	a	businessman	trying	to	recruit	an	able	executive	from	a rival.	At	one	such	meeting,	Luca	pretended	to	be	swayed,	then	said,	“But	one thing	must	be	understood.	I	will	never	go	against	the	Godfather.	Don	Corleone	is a	man	I	respect.	I	understand	that	he	must	put	his	sons	before	me	in	the	Family business.”
																Bruno	Tattaglia	was	one	of	the	new	generation	with	a	barely	hidden contempt	for	the	old	Moustache	Petes	like	Luca	Brasi,	Don	Corleone	and	even his	own	father.	He	was	just	a	little	too	respectful.	Now	he	said,	“My	father wouldn’t	expect	you	to	do	anything	against	the	Corleones.	Why	should	he? Everybody	gets	along	with	everybody	else	now,	it’s	not	like	the	old	days.	It’s just	that	if	you’re	looking	for	a	new	job,	I	can	pass	along	the	word	to	my	father. There’s	always	need	for	a	man	like	you	in	our	business.	It’s	a	hard	business	and it	needs	hard	men	to	keep	it	running	smooth.	Let	me	know	if	you	ever	make	up your	mind.”
																Luca	shrugged.	“It’s	not	so	bad	where	I’m	at.”	And	so	they	left	it.
																The	general	idea	had	been	to	lead	the	Tattaglias	to	believe	that	he knew	about	the	lucrative	narcotics	operation	and	that	he	wanted	a	piece	of	it free-lance.	In	that	fashion	he	might	hear	something	about	Sollozzo’s	plans	if	the
Turk	had	any,	or	whether	he	was	getting	ready	to	step	on	the	toes	of	Don Corleone.	After	waiting	for	two	months	with	nothing	else	happening,	Luca reported	to	the	Don	that	obviously	Sollozzo	was	taking	his	defeat	graciously. The	Don	had	told	him	to	keep	trying	but	merely	as	a	sideline,	not	to	press	it.
																Luca	had	dropped	into	the	nightclub	the	evening	before	Don Corleone’s	being	shot.	Almost	immediately	Bruno	Tattaglia	had	come	to	his table	and	sat	down.
																“I	have	a	friend	who	wants	to	talk	to	you,”	he	said.
																“Bring	him	over,”	Luca	said.	“I’ll	talk	to	any	friend	of	yours.”
																“No,”	Bruno	said.	“He	wants	to	see	you	in	private.”
																“Who	is	he?”	Luca	asked.
																“Just	a	friend	of	mine,”	Bruno	Tattaglia	said.	“He	wants	to	put	a proposition	to	you.	Can	you	meet	him	later	on	tonight?”
																“Sure,”	Luca	said.	“What	time	and	where?”
																Tattaglia	said	softly,	“The	club	closes	at	four	in	the	morning.	Why don’t	you	meet	in	here	while	the	waiters	are	cleaning	up?”
																They	knew	his	habits,	Luca	thought,	they	must	have	been	checking him	out.	He	usually	got	up	about	three	or	four	in	the	afternoon	and	had breakfast,	then	amused	himself	by	gambling	with	cronies	in	the	Family	or	had	a girl.	Sometimes	he	saw	one	of	the	midnight	movies	and	then	would	drop	in	for	a drink	at	one	of	the	clubs.	He	never	went	to	bed	before	dawn.	So	the	suggestion of	a	four	A.M.	meeting	was	not	as	outlandish	as	it	seemed.
																“Sure,	sure,”	he	said.	“I’ll	be	back	at	four.”	He	left	the	club	and	caught a	cab	to	his	furnished	room	on	Tenth	Avenue.	He	boarded	with	an	Italian	family to	which	he	was	distantly	related.	His	two	rooms	were	separated	from	the	rest	of
their	railroad	flat	by	a	special	door.	He	liked	the	arrangement	because	it	gave him	some	family	life	and	also	protection	against	surprise	where	he	was	most vulnerable.
																The	sly	Turkish	fox	was	going	to	show	his	bushy	tail,	Luca	thought.	If things	went	far	enough,	if	Sollozzo	committed	himself	tonight,	maybe	the	whole thing	could	be	wound	up	as	a	Christmas	present	for	the	Don.	In	his	room,	Luca unlocked	the	trunk	beneath	the	bed	and	took	out	a	bulletproof	vest.	It	was	heavy. He	undressed	and	put	it	on	over	his	woolen	underwear,	then	put	his	shirt	and jacket	over	it.	He	thought	for	a	moment	of	calling	the	Don’s	house	at	Long Beach	to	tell	him	of	this	new	development	but	he	knew	the	Don	never	talked over	the	phone,	to	anyone,	and	the	Don	had	given	him	this	assignment	in	secret and	so	did	not	want	anyone,	not	even	Hagen	or	his	eldest	son,	to	know	about	it.
																Luca	always	carried	a	gun.	He	had	a	license	to	carry	a	gun,	probably the	most	expensive	gun	license	ever	issued	anyplace,	anytime.	It	had	cost	a	total of	ten	thousand	dollars	but	it	would	keep	him	out	of	jail	if	he	was	frisked	by	the cops.	As	a	top	executive	operating	official	of	the	Family	he	rated	the	license.	But tonight,	just	in	case	he	could	finish	off	the	job,	he	wanted	a	“safe”	gun.	One	that could	not	possibly	be	traced.	But	then	thinking	the	matter	over,	he	decided	that he	would	just	listen	to	the	proposition	tonight	and	report	back	to	the	Godfather, Don	Corleone.
																He	made	his	way	back	to	the	club	but	he	did	not	drink	any	more. Instead	he	wandered	out	to	48th	Street,	where	he	had	a	leisurely	late	supper	at Patsy’s,	his	favorite	Italian	restaurant.	When	it	was	time	for	his	appointment	he drifted	uptown	to	the	club	entrance.	The	doorman	was	no	longer	there	when	he went	in.	The	hatcheck	girl	was	gone.	Only	Bruno	Tattaglia	waited	to	greet	him and	lead	him	to	the	deserted	bar	at	the	side	of	the	room.	Before	him	he	could	see the	desert	of	small	tables	with	the	polished	yellow	wood	dance	floor	gleaming like	a	small	diamond	in	the	middle	of	them.	In	the	shadows	was	the	empty bandstand,	out	of	it	grew	the	skeleton	metal	stalk	of	a	microphone.
																Luca	sat	at	the	bar	and	Bruno	Tattaglia	went	behind	it.	Luca	refused the	drink	offered	to	him	and	lit	a	cigarette.	It	was	possible	that	this	would	turn out	to	be	something	else,	not	the	Turk.	But	then	he	saw	Sollozzo	emerge	out	of
the	shadows	at	the	far	end	of	the	room.
																Sollozzo	shook	his	hand	and	sat	at	the	bar	next	to	him.	Tattaglia	put	a glass	in	front	of	the	Turk,	who	nodded	his	thanks.	“Do	you	know	who	I	am?” asked	Sollozzo.
																Luca	nodded.	He	smiled	grimly.	The	rats	were	being	flushed	out	of their	holes.	It	would	be	his	pleasure	to	take	care	of	this	renegade	Sicilian.
																“Do	you	know	what	I	am	going	to	ask	of	you?”	Sollozzo	asked.
																Luca	shook	his	head.
																“There’s	big	business	to	be	made,”	Sollozzo	said.	“I	mean	millions	for everybody	at	the	top	level.	On	the	first	shipment.	I	can	guarantee	you	fifty thousand	dollars.	I’m	talking	about	drugs.	It’s	the	coming	thing.”
																Luca	said,	“Why	come	to	me?	You	want	me	to	talk	to	my	Don?”
																Sollozzo	grimaced.	“I’ve	already	talked	to	the	Don.	He	wants	no	part of	it.	All	right,	I	can	do	without	him.	But	I	need	somebody	strong	to	protect	the operation	physically.	I	understand	you’re	not	happy	with	your	Family,	you	might make	a	switch.”
																Luca	shrugged.	“If	the	offer	is	good	enough.”
																Sollozzo	had	been	watching	him	intently	and	seemed	to	have	come	to a	decision.	“Think	about	my	offer	for	a	few	days	and	then	we’ll	talk	again,”	he said.	He	put	out	his	hand	but	Luca	pretended	not	to	see	it	and	busied	himself putting	a	cigarette	in	his	mouth.	Behind	the	bar,	Bruno	Tattaglia	made	a	lighter appear	magically	and	held	it	to	Luca’s	cigarette.	And	then	he	did	a	strange	thing. He	dropped	the	lighter	on	the	bar	and	grabbed	Luca’s	right	hand,	holding	it	tight.
																Luca	reacted	instantly,	his	body	slipping	off	the	bar	stool	and	trying	to twist	away.	But	Sollozzo	had	grabbed	his	other	hand	at	the	wrist.	Still,	Luca	was
too	strong	for	both	of	them	and	would	have	broken	free	except	that	a	man stepped	out	of	the	shadows	behind	him	and	threw	a	thin	silken	cord	around	his neck.	The	cord	pulled	tight,	choking	off	Luca’s	breath.	His	face	became	purple, the	strength	in	his	arms	drained	away.	Tattaglia	and	Sollozzo	held	his	hands easily	now,	and	they	stood	there	curiously	childlike	as	the	man	behind	Luca pulled	the	cord	around	Luca’s	neck	tighter	and	tighter.	Suddenly	the	floor	was wet	and	slippery.	Luca’s	sphincter,	no	longer	under	control,	opened,	the	waste	of his	body	spilled	out.	There	was	no	strength	in	him	anymore	and	his	legs	folded, his	body	sagged.	Sollozzo	and	Tattaglia	let	his	hands	go	and	only	the	strangler stayed	with	the	victim,	sinking	to	his	knees	to	follow	Luca’s	falling	body, drawing	the	cord	so	tight	that	it	cut	into	the	flesh	of	the	neck	and	disappeared. Luca’s	eyes	were	bulging	out	of	his	head	as	if	in	the	utmost	surprise	and	this surprise	was	the	only	humanity	remaining	to	him.	He	was	dead.
																“I	don’t	want	him	found,”	Sollozzo	said.	“It’s	important	that	he	not	be found	right	now.”	He	turned	on	his	heel	and	left,	disappearing	back	into	the shadows.
															
Chapter	8
	
																The	day	after	the	shooting	of	Don	Corleone	was	a	busy	time	for	the Family.	Michael	stayed	by	the	phone	relaying	messages	to	Sonny.	Tom	Hagen was	busy	trying	to	find	a	mediator	satisfactory	to	both	parties	so	that	a conference	could	be	arranged	with	Sollozzo.	The	Turk	had	suddenly	become cagey,	perhaps	he	knew	that	the	Family	button	men	of	Clemenza	and	Tessio were	ranging	far	and	wide	over	the	city	in	an	attempt	to	pick	up	his	trail.	But Sollozzo	was	sticking	close	to	his	hideout,	as	were	all	top	members	of	the Tattaglia	Family.	This	was	expected	by	Sonny,	an	elementary	precaution	he knew	the	enemy	was	bound	to	take.
																Clemenza	was	tied	up	with	Paulie	Gat	to.	Tessio	had	been	given	the assignment	of	trying	to	track	down	the	whereabouts	of	Luca	Brasi.	Luca	had	not
