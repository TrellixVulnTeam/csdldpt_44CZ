He	tried	to	think	things	out.	He	tried	to	imagine	how	his	father	would react	in	a	like	situation.	He	had	known	immediately	that	this	was	an	attack	by Sollozzo,	but	Sollozzo	would	never	have	dared	to	eliminate	so	high-ranking	a leader	as	the	Don	unless	he	was	backed	by	other	powerful	people.	The	phone, ringing	for	the	fourth	time,	interrupted	his	thoughts.	The	voice	on	the	other	end was	very	soft,	very	gentle.	“Santino	Corleone?”	it	asked.
																“Yeah,”	Sonny	said.
																“We	have	Tom	Hagen,”	the	voice	said.	“In	about	three	hours	he’ll	be released	with	our	proposition.	Don’t	do	anything	rash	until	you’ve	heard	what	he has	to	say.	You	can	only	cause	a	lot	of	trouble.	What’s	done	is	done.	Everybody has	to	be	sensible	now.	Don’t	lose	that	famous	temper	of	yours.”	The	voice	was slightly	mocking.	Sonny	couldn’t	be	sure,	but	it	sounded	like	Sollozzo.	He	made his	voice	sound	muted,	depressed.	“I’ll	wait,”	he	said.	He	heard	the	receiver	on the	other	end	click.	He	looked	at	his	heavy	gold-banded	wristwatch	and	noted the	exact	time	of	the	call	and	jotted	it	down	on	the	tablecloth.
																He	sat	at	the	kitchen	table,	frowning.	His	wife	asked,	“Sonny,	what	is it?”	He	told	her	calmly,	“They	shot	the	old	man.”	When	he	saw	the	shock	on	her face	he	said	roughly,	“Don’t	worry,	he’s	not	dead.	And	nothing	else	is	going	to happen.”	He	did	not	tell	her	about	Hagen.	And	then	the	phone	rang	for	the	fifth time.
																It	was	Clemenza.	The	fat	man’s	voice	came	wheezing	over	the	phone in	gruntlike	gasps.	“You	hear	about	your	father?”	he	asked.
																“Yeah.”	Sonny	said.	“But	he’s	not	dead.”	There	was	a	long	pause	over the	phone	and	then	Clemenza’s	voice	came	packed	with	emotion,	“Thank	God, thank	God.”	Then	anxiously,	“You	sure?	I	got	word	he	was	dead	in	the	street.”
																“He’s	alive,”	Sonny	said.	He	was	listening	intently	to	every	intonation in	Clemenza’s	voice.	The	emotion	had	seemed	genuine	but	it	was	part	of	the	fat man’s	profession	to	be	a	good	actor.
																“You’ll	have	to	carry	the	ball,	Sonny,”	Clemenza	said.	“What	do	you
want	me	to	do?”
																“Get	over	to	my	father’s	house,”	Sonny	said.	“Bring	Paulie	Gat	to.”
																“That’s	all?”	Clemenza	asked.	“Don’t	you	want	me	to	send	some people	to	the	hospital	and	your	place?”
																“No,	I	just	want	you	and	Paulie	Gat	to,”	Sonny	said.	There	was	a	long pause.	Clemenza	was	getting	the	message.	To	make	it	a	little	more	natural, Sonny	asked,	“Where	the	hell	was	Paulie	anyway?	What	the	hell	was	he	doing?”
																There	was	no	longer	any	wheezing	on	the	other	end	of	the	line. Clemenza’s	voice	was	guarded.	“Paulie	was	sick,	he	had	a	cold,	so	he	stayed home.	He’s	been	a	little	sick	all	winter.”
																Sonny	was	instantly	alert.	“How	many	times	did	he	stay	home	the	last couple	of	months?”
																“Maybe	three	or	four	times,”	Clemenza	said.	“I	always	asked	Freddie if	he	wanted	another	guy	but	he	said	no.	There’s	been	no	cause,	the	last	ten	years things	been	smooth,	you	know.”
																“Yeah,”	Sonny	said.	“I’ll	see	you	at	my	father’s	house.	Be	sure	you bring	Paulie.	Pick	him	up	on	your	way	over.	I	don’t	care	how	sick	he	is.	You	got that?”	He	slammed	down	the	phone	without	waiting	for	an	answer.
																His	wife	was	weeping	silently.	He	stared	at	her	for	a	moment,	then said	in	a	harsh	voice,	“	Any	of	our	people	call,	tell	them	to	get	me	in	my	father’s house	on	his	special	phone.	Anybody	else	call,	you	don’t	know	nothing.	If Tom’s	wife	calls,	tell	her	that	Tom	won’t	be	home	for	a	while,	he’s	on	business.”
																He	pondered	for	a	moment.”	A	couple	of	our	people	will	come	to	stay here.”	He	saw	her	look	of	fright	and	said	impatiently,	“You	don’t	have	to	be scared,	I	just	want	them	here.	Do	whatever	they	tell	you	to	do.	If	you	wanta	talk to	me,	get	me	on	Pop’s	special	phone	but	don’t	call	me	unless	it’s	really
important.	And	don’t	worry.”	He	went	out	of	the	house.
																Darkness	had	fallen	and	the	December	wind	whipped	through	the mall.	Sonny	had	no	fear	about	stepping	out	into	the	night.	All	eight	houses	were owned	by	Don	Corleone.	At	the	mouth	of	the	mall	the	two	houses	on	either	side were	rented	by	family	retainers	with	their	own	families	and	star	boarders,	single men	who	lived	in	the	basement	apartments.	Of	the	remaining	six	houses	that formed	the	rest	of	the	half	circle,	one	was	inhabited	by	Tom	Hagen	and	his family,	his	own,	and	the	smallest	and	least	ostentatious	by	the	Don	himself.	The other	three	houses	were	given	rent-free	to	retired	friends	of	the	Don	with	the understanding	that	they	would	be	vacated	whenever	he	requested.	The	harmlesslooking	mall	was	an	impregnable	fortress.
																All	eight	houses	were	equipped	with	floodlights	which	bathed	the grounds	around	them	and	made	the	mall	impossible	to	lurk	in.	Sonny	went across	the	street	to	his	father’s	house	and	let	himself	inside	with	his	own	key.	He yelled	out,	“Ma,	where	are	you?”	and	his	mother	came	out	of	the	kitchen. Behind	her	rose	the	smell	of	frying	peppers.	Before	she	could	say	anything, Sonny	took	her	by	the	arm	and	made	her	sit	down.	“I	just	got	a	call,”	he	said. “Now	don’t	get	worried.	Pop’s	in	the	hospital,	he’s	hurt.	Get	dressed	and	get ready	to	get	down	there.	I’ll	have	a	car	and	a	driver	for	you	in	a	little	while. OK?”
																His	mother	looked	at	him	steadily	for	a	moment	and	then	asked	in Italian,	“Have	they	shot	him?”
																Sonny	nodded.	His	mother	bowed	her	head	for	a	moment.	Then	she went	back	into	the	kitchen.	Sonny	followed	her.	He	watched	her	turn	off	the	gas under	the	panful	of	peppers	and	then	go	out	and	up	to	the	bedroom.	He	took peppers	from	the	pan	and	bread	from	the	basket	on	the	table	and	made	a	sloppy sandwich	with	hot	olive	oil	dripping	from	his	fingers.	He	went	into	the	huge corner	room	that	was	his	father’s	office	and	took	the	special	phone	from	a	locked cabinet	box.	The	phone	had	been	especially	installed	and	was	listed	under	a phony	name	and	a	phony	address.	The	first	person	he	called	was	Luca	Brasi. There	was	no	answer.	Then	he	called	the	safety-valve	caporegime	in	Brooklyn,	a man	of	unquestioned	loyalty	to	the	Don.	This	man’s	name	was	Tessio.	Sonny
told	him	what	had	happened	and	what	he	wanted.	Tessio	was	to	recruit	fifty absolutely	reliable	men.	He	was	to	send	guards	to	the	hospital,	he	was	to	send men	out	to	Long	Beach	to	work	here.	Tessio	asked,	“Did	they	get	Clemenza too?”	Sonny	said,	“I	don’t	want	to	use	Clemenza’s	people	right	now.”	Tessio understood	immediately,	there	was	a	pause,	and	then	he	said,	“Excuse	me, Sonny,	I	say	this	as	your	father	would	say	it.	Don’t	move	too	fast.	I	can’t	believe Clemenza	would	betray	us.”
																“Thanks,”	Sonny	said.	“I	don’t	think	so	but	I	have	to	be	careful. Right?”
																“Right,”	Tessio	said.”
																Another	thing,”	Sonny	said.	“My	kid	brother	Mike	goes	to	college	in Hanover,	New	Hampshire.	Get	some	people	we	know	in	Boston	to	go	up	and	get him	and	bring	him	down	here	to	the	house	until	this	blows	over.	I’ll	call	him	up so	he’ll	expect	them.	Again	I’m	just	playing	the	percentages,	just	to	make	sure.”
																“OK,”	Tessio	said,	“I’ll	be	over	your	father’s	house	as	soon	as	I	get things	rolling.	OK?	You	know	my	boys,	right?”
																“Yeah,”	Sonny	said.	He	hung	up.	He	went	over	to	a	small	wall	safe and	unlocked	it.	From	it	he	took	an	indexed	book	bound	in	blue	leather.	He opened	it	to	the	T’s	until	he	found	the	entry	he	was	looking	for.	It	read,	“Ray Farrell	$5,000	Christmas	Eve.”	This	was	followed	by	a	telephone	number. Sonny	dialed	the	number	and	said,	“Farrell?”	The	man	on	the	other	end answered,	“Yes.”	Sonny	said,	“This	is	Santino	Corleone.	I	want	you	to	do	me	a favor	and	I	want	you	to	do	it	right	away.	I	want	you	to	check	two	phone	numbers and	give	me	all	the	calls	they	got	and	all	the	calls	they	made	for	the	last	three months.”	He	gave	Farrell	the	number	of	Paulie	Gatto	‘s	home	and	Clemenza’s home.	Then	he	said,	“This	is	important.	Get	it	to	me	before	midnight	and	you’ll have	an	extra	very	Merry	Christmas.”
																Before	he	settled	back	to	think	things	out	he	gave	Luca	Brasi’s	number one	more	call.	Again	there	was	no	answer.	This	worried	him	but	he	put	it	out	of his	mind.	Luca	would	come	to	the	house	as	soon	as	he	heard	the	news.	Sonny leaned	back	in	the	swivel	chair.	In	an	hour	the	house	would	be	swarming	with Family	people	and	he	would	have	to	tell	them	all	what	to	do,	and	now	that	he finally	had	time	to	think	he	realized	how	serious	the	situation	was.	It	was	the first	challenge	to	the	Corleone	Family	and	their	power	in	ten	years.	There	was	no doubt	that	Sollozzo	was	behind	it,	but	he	would	never	have	dared	attempt	such	a stroke	unless	he	had	support	from	at	least	one	of	the	five	great	New	York families.	And	that	support	must	have	come	from	the	Tattaglias.	Which	meant	a full-scale	war	or	an	immediate	settlement	on	Sollozzo’s	terms.	Sonny	smiled grimly.	The	wily	Turk	had	planned	well	but	he	had	been	unlucky.	The	old	man was	alive	and	so	it	was	war.	With	Luca	Brasi	and	the	resources	of	the	Corleone Family	there	could	be	but	one	outcome.	But	again	the	nagging	worry.	Where was	Luca	Brasi?
	
Chapter	3
	
																Counting	the	driver,	there	were	four	men	in	the	car	with	Hagen.	They
put	him	in	the	back	seat,	in	the	middle	of	the	two	men	who	had	come	up	behind him	in	the	street.	Sollozzo	sat	up	front.	The	man	on	Hagen’s	right	reached	over across	his	body	and	tilted	Hagen’s	hat	over	his	eyes	so	that	he	could	not	see. “Don’t	even	move	your	pinkie,”	he	said.
																It	was	a	short	ride,	not	more	than	twenty	minutes	and	when	they	got out	of	the	car	Hagen	could	not	recognize	the	neighborhood	because	darkness	had fallen.	They	led	him	into	a	basement	apartment	and	made	him’	sit	on	a	straightbacked	kitchen	chair.	Sollozzo	sat	across	the	kitchen	table	from	him.	His	dark face	had	a	peculiarly	vulturine	look.
																“I	don’t	want	you	to	be	afraid,”	he	said.	“I	know	you’re	not	in	the muscle	end	of	the	Family.	I	want	you	to	help	the	Corleones	and	I	want	you	to help	me.”
																Hagen’s	hands	were	shaking	as	he	put	a	cigarette	in	his	mouth.	One	of the	men	brought	a	bottle	of	rye	to	the	table	and	gave	him	a	slug	of	it	in	a	china coffee	cup.	Hagen	drank	the	fiery	liquid	gratefully.	It	steadied	his	hands	and took	the	weakness	out	of	his	legs.
																“Your	boss	is	dead,”	Sollozzo	said.	He	paused,	surprised	at	the	tears that	sprang	to	Hagen’s	eyes.	Then	he	went	on.	“We	got	him	outside	his	office,	in the	street.	As	soon	as	I	got	the	word,	I	picked	you	up.	You	have	to	make	the peace	between	me	and	Sonny.”
																Hagen	didn’t	answer.	He	was	surprised	at	his	own	grief.	And	the feeling	of	desolation	mixed	with	his	fear	of	death.	Sollozzo	was	speaking	again. “Sonny	was	hot	for	my	deal.	Right?	You	know	it’s	the	smart	thing	to	do	too. Narcotics	is	the	coming	thing.	There’s	so	much	money	in	it	that	everybody	can get	rich	just	in	a	couple	of	years.	The	Don	was	an	old	‘Moustache	Pete,’	his	day was	over	but	he	didn’t	know	it.	Now	he’s	dead,	nothing	can	bring	him	back.	I’m ready	to	make	a	new	deal,	I	want	you	to	talk	Sonny	into	taking	it.”
																Hagen	said,	“You	haven’t	got	a	chance.	Sonny	will	come	after	you with	everything	he’s	got.”
																Sollozzo	said	impatiently,	“That’s	gonna	be	his	first	reaction.	You have	to	talk	some	sense	to	him.	The	Tattaglia	Family	stands	behind	me	with	all their	people.	The	other	New	York	families	will	go	along	with	anything	that	will stop	a	full-scale	war	between	us.	Our	war	has	to	hurt	them	and	their	businesses. If	Sonny	goes	along	with	the	deal,	the	other	Families	in	the	country	will	consider it	none	of	their	affair,	even	the	Don’s	oldest	friends.”
																Hagen	stared	down	at	his	hands,	not	answering.	Sollozzo	went	on persuasively.	“The	Don	was	slipping.	In	the	old	days	I	could	never	have	gotten to	him.	The	other	Families	distrust	him	because	he	made	you	his	Consigliere	and you’re	not	even	Italian,	much	less	Sicilian.	If	it	goes	to	all-out	war	the	Corleone Family	will	be	smashed	and	everybody	loses,	me	included.	I	need	the	Family political	contacts	more	than	I	need	the	money	even.	So	talk	to	Sonny,	talk	to	the caporegimes;	you’ll	save	a	lot	of	bloodshed.”
																Hagen	held	out	his	china	cup	for	more	whiskey.	“I’ll	try,”	he	said. “But	Sonny	is	strong-headed.	And	even	Sonny	won’t	be	able	to	call	off	Luca. You	have	to	worry	about	Luca.	I’ll	have	to	worry	about	Luca	if	I	go	for	your deal.”
																Sollozzo	said	quietly,	“I’ll	take	care	of	Luca.	You	take	care	of	Sonny and	the	other	two	kids.	Listen,	you	can	tell	them	that	Freddie	would	have	gotten it	today	with	his	old	man	but	my	people	had	strict	orders	not	to	gun	him.	I	didn’t want	any	more	hard	feelings	than	necessary.	You	can	tell	them	that,	Freddie	is alive	because	of	me.”
																Finally	Hagen’s	mind	was	working.	For	the	first	time	he	really believed	that	Sollozzo	did	not	mean	to	kill	him	or	hold	him	as	a	hostage.	The sudden	relief	from	fear	that	flooded	his	body	made	him	flush	with	shame. Sollozzo	watched	him	with	a	quiet	understanding	smile.	Hagen	began	to	think things	out.	If	he	did	not	agree	to	argue	Sollozzo’s	case,	he	might	be	killed.	But then	he	realized	that	Sollozzo	expected	him	only	to	present	it	and	present	it properly,	as	he	was	bound	to	do	as	a	responsible	Consigliere.	And	now,	thinking about	it,	he	also	realized	that	Sollozzo	was	right.	An	unlimited	war	between	the Tattaglias	and	the	Corleones	must	be	avoided	at	all	costs.	The	Corleones	must bury	their	dead	and	forget,	make	a	deal.	And	then	when	the	time	was	right	they
could	move	against	Sollozzo.
																But	glancing	up,	he	realized	that	Sollozzo	knew	exactly	what	he	was thinking.	The	Turk	was	smiling.	And	then	it	struck	Hagen.	What	had	happened to	Luca	Brasi	that	Sollozzo	was	so	unconcerned?	Had	Luca	made	a	deal?	He remembered	that	on	the	night	Don	Corleone	had	refused	Sollozzo,	Luca	had been	summoned	into	the	office	for	a	private	conference	with	the	Don.	But	now was	not	the	time	to	worry	about	such	details.	He	had	to	get	back	to	the	safety	of the	Corleone	Family	fortress	in	Long	Beach.	“I’ll	do	my	best,”	he	said	to Sollozzo.	“I	believe	you’re	right,	it’s	even	what	the	Don	would	want	us	to	do.”
																Sollozzo	nodded	gravely.	“Fine,”	he	said.	“I	don’t	like	bloodshed,	I’m a	businessman	and	blood	costs	too	much	money.”	At	that	moment	the	phone rang	and	one	of	the	men	sitting	behind	Hagen	went	to	answer	it.	He	listened	and then	said	curtly,	“OK,	I’ll	tell	him.”	He	hung	up	the	phone,	went	to	Sollozzo’s side	and	whispered	in	the	Turk’s	ear.	Hagen	saw	Sollozzo’s	face	go	pale,	his eyes	glitter	with	rage.	He	himself	felt	a	thrill	of	fear.	Sollozzo	was	looking	at him	speculatively	and	suddenly	Hagen	knew	that	he	was	no	longer	going	to	be set	free.	That	something	had	happened	that	might	mean	his	death.	Sollozzo	said, “The	old	man	is	still	alive.	Five	bullets	in	his	Sicilian	hide	and	he’s	still	alive.” He	gave	a	fatalistic	shrug.	“Bad	luck,”	he	said	to	Hagen.	“Bad	luck	for	me.	Bad luck	for	you.”
															
Chapter	4
	
																When	Michael	Corleone	arrived	at	his	father’s	house	in	Long	Beach he	found	the	narrow	entrance	mouth	of	the	mall	blocked	off	with	a	link	chain. The	mall	itself	was	bright	with	the	floodlights	of	all	eight	houses,	outlining	at least	ten	cars	parked	along	the	curving	cement	walk.
																Two	men	he	didn’t	know	were	leaning	against	the	chain.	One	of	them asked	in	a	Brooklyn	accent,	“Who’re	you?”
																He	told	them.	Another	man	came	out	of	the	nearest	house	and	peered at	his	face.	“That’s	the	Don’s	kid,”	he	said.	“I’ll	bring	him	inside.”	Mike followed	this	man	to	his	father’s	house,	where	two	men	at	the	door	let	him	and his	escort	pass	inside.
																The	house	seemed	to	be	full	of	men	he	didn’t	know,	until	he	went	into the	living	room.	There	Michael	saw	Tom	Hagen’s	wife,	Theresa,	sitting	stiffly on	the	sofa,	smoking	a	cigarette.	On	the	coffee	table	in	front	of	her	was	a	glass of	whiskey.	On	the	other	side	of	the	sofa	sat	the	bulky	Clemenza.	The caporegime’s	face	was	impassive,	but	he	was	sweating	and	the	cigar	in	his	hand glistened	slickly	black	with	his	saliva.
																Clemenza	came	to	wring	his	hand	in	a	consoling	way,	muttering, “Your	mother	is	at	the	hospital	with	your	father,	he’s	going	to	be	all	right.” Paulie	Gatto	stood	up	to	shake	hands.	Michael	looked	at	him	curiously.	He	knew Paulie	was	his	father’s	bodyguard	but	did	not	know	that	Paulie	had	stayed	home sick	that	day.	But	he	sensed	tension	in	the	thin	dark	face.	He	knew	Gatto	‘s reputation	as	an	up-and-coming	man,	a	very	quick	man	who	knew	how	to	get delicate	jobs	done	without	complications,	and	today	he	had	failed	in	his	duty.	He noticed	several	other	men	in	the	comers	of	the	room	but	he	did	not	recognize them.	They	were	not	of	Clemenza’s	people.	Michael	put	these	facts	together	and understood.	Clemenza	and	Gatto	were	suspect.	Thinking	that	Paulie	had	been	at the	scene,	he	asked	the	ferret-faced	young	man,	“How	is	Freddie?	He	OK?”
																“The	doctor	gave	him	a	shot,”	Clemenza	said.	“He’s	sleeping.”
																Michael	went	to	Hagen’s	wife	and	bent	down	to	kiss	her	cheek.	They had	always	liked	each	other.	He	whispered,	“Don’t	worry,	Tom	will	be	OK. Have	you	talked	to	Sonny	yet?”
																Theresa	clung	to	him	for	a	moment	and	shook	her	head.	She	was	a delicate,	very	pretty	woman,	more	American	than	Italian,	and	very	scared.	He took	her	hand	and	lifted	her	off	the	sofa.	Then	he	led	her	into	his	father’s	corner room	office.
																Sonny	was	sprawled	out	in	his	chair	behind	the	desk	holding	a	yellow
pad	in	one	hand	and	a	pencil	in	the	other.	The	only	other	man	in	the	room	with him	was	the	caporegime	Tessio,	whom	Michael	recognized	and	immediately realized	that	it	must	be	his	men	who	were	in	the	house	and	forming	the	new palace	guard.	He	too	had	a	pencil	and	pad	in	his	hands.
																When	Sonny	saw	them	he	came	from	behind	his	desk	and	took Hagen’s	wife	in	his	arms.	“Don’t	worry,	Theresa,”	he	said.	“Tom’s	OK.	They just	wanta	give	him	the	proposition,	they	said	they’d	turn	him	loose.	He’s	not	on the	operating	end,	he’s	just	our	lawyer.	There’s	no	reason	for	anybody	to	do	him harm.”
																He	released	Theresa	and	then	to	Michael’s	surprise	he	too,	got	a	hug and	a	kiss	on	the	cheek.	He	pushed	Sonny	away	and	said	grinning,	“	After	I	get used	to	you	beating	me	up	I	gotta	put	up	with	this?”	They	had	often	fought	when they	were	younger.
																Sonny	shrugged.	“Listen,	kid,	I	was	worried	when	I	couldn’t	get	ahold of	you	in	that	hick	town.	Not	that	I	gave	a	crap	if	they	knocked	you	off,	but	I didn’t	like	the	idea	of	bringing	the	news	to	the	old	lady.	I	had	to	tell	her	about Pop.”
																“How’d	she	take	it?”	Michael	asked.
																“Good,”	Sonny	said.	“She’s	been	through	it	before.	Me	too.	You	were too	young	to	know	about	it	and	then	things	got	pretty	smooth	while	you	were growing	up.”	He	paused	and	then	said,	“She’s	down	at	the	hospital	with	the	old man.	He’s	gonna	pull	through.”
																“How	about	us	going	down?”	Michael	asked.
																Sonny	shook	his	head	and	said	dryly,	“I	can’t	leave	this	house	until	it’s all	over.”	The	phone	rang.	Sonny	picked	it	up	and	listened	intently.	While	he was	listening	Michael	sauntered	over	to	the	desk	and	glanced	down	at	the	yellow pad	Sonny	had	been	writing	on.	There	was	a	list	of	seven	names.
