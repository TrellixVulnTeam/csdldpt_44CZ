judgment	and	procedure.	He	said	eagerly,	“The	Tattaglia	family	guarantees	the return	of	our	investment	without	any	percentage	from	us?”
																Hagen	was	horrified	at	this	break.	He	saw	the	Don	turn	cold, malevolent	eyes	on	his	eldest	son,	who	froze	in	uncomprehending	dismay. Sollozzo’s	eyes	flickered	again	but	this	time	with	satisfaction.	He	had	discovered a	chink	in	the	Don’s	fortress.	When	the	Don	spoke	his	voice	held	a	dismissal. “Young	people	are	greedy,”	he	said.	“And	today	they	have	no	manners.	They interrupt	their	elders.	They	meddle.	But	I	have	a	sentimental	weakness	for	my children	and	I	have	spoiled	them.	As	you	see.	Signor	Sollozzo,	my	no	is	final. Let	me	say	that	I	myself	wish	you	good	fortune	in	your	business.	It	has	no conflict	with	my	own.	I’m	sorry	that	I	had	to	disappoint	you.”
																Sollozzo	bowed,	shook	the	Don’s	hand	and	let	Hagen	take	him	to	his car	outside.	There	was	no	expression	on	his	face	when	he	said	good-bye	to Hagen.
																Back	in	the	room,	Don	Corleone	asked	Hagen,	“What	did	you	think	of that	man?”
																“He’s	a	Sicilian,”	Hagen	said	dryly.
																The	Don	nodded	his	head	thoughtfully.	Then	he	turned	to	his	son	and said	gently,	“Santino,	never	let	anyone	outside	the	family	know	what	you	are thinking.	Never	let	them	know	what	you	have	under	your	fingernails.	I	think your	brain	is	going	soft	from	all	that	comedy	you	play	with	that	young	girl.	Stop it	and	pay	attention	to	business.	Now	get	out	of	my	sight.”
																Hagen	saw	the	surprise	on	Sonny’s	face,	then	anger	at	his	father’s reproach.	Did	he	really	think	the	Don	would	be	ignorant	of	his	conquest,	Hagen wondered.	And	did	he	really	not	know	what	a	dangerous	mistake	he	had	made this	morning?	If	that	were	true,	Hagen	would	never	wish	to	be	the	Consigliere	to the	Don	of	Santino	Corleone.
																Don	Corleone	waited	until	Sonny	had	left	the	room.	Then	he	sank back	into	his	leather	armchair	and	motioned	brusquely	for	a	drink.	Hagen	poured
him	a	glass	of	anisette.	The	Don	looked	up	at	him.	“Send	Luca	Brasi	to	see	me,” he	said.
	
																Three	months	later,	Hagen	hurried	through	the	paper	work	in	his	city office	hoping	to	leave	early	enough	for	some	Christmas	shopping	for	his	wife and	children.	He	was	interrupted	by	a	phone	call	from	a	Johnny	Fontane bubbling	with	high	spirits.	The	picture	had	been	shot,	the	rushes,	whatever	the hell	they	were,	Hagen	thought,	were	fabulous.	He	was	sending	the	Don	a	present for	Christmas	that	would	knock	his	eyes	out,	he’d	bring	it	himself	but	there	were some	little	things	to	be	done	in	the	movie.	He	would	have	to	stay	out	on	the Coast.	Hagen	tried	to	conceal	his	impatience.	Johnny	Fontane’s	charm	had always	been	lost	on	him.	But	his	interest	was	aroused.	“What	is	it?”	he	asked. Johnny	Fontane	chuckled	and	said,	“I	can’t	tell,	that’s	the	best	part	of	a Christmas	present.”	Hagen	immediately	lost	all	interest	and	finally	managed, politely,	to	hang	up.
																Ten	minutes	later	his	secretary	told	him	that	Connie	Corleone	was	on the	phone	and	wanted	to	speak	to	him.	Hagen	sighed.	As	a	young	girl	Connie had	been	nice,	as	a	married	woman	she	was	a	nuisance.	She	made	complaints about	her	husband.	She	kept	going	home	to	visit	her	mother	for	two	or	three days.	And	Carlo	Rizzi	was	turning	out	to	be	a	real	loser.	He	had	been	fixed	up with	a	nice	little	business	and	was	running	it	into	the	ground.	He	was	also drinking,	whoring	around,	gambling	and	beating	his	wife	up	occasionally. Connie	hadn’t	told	her	family	about	that	but	she	had	told	Hagen.	He	wondered what	new	tale	of	woe	she	had	for	him	now.
																But	the	Christmas	spirit	seemed	to	have	cheered	her	up.	She	just wanted	to	ask	Hagen	what	her	father	would	really	like	for	Christmas.	And	Sonny and	Fred	and	Mike.	She	already	knew	what	she	would	get	her	mother.	Hagen made	some	suggestions,	all	of	which	she	rejected	as	silly.	Finally	she	let	him	go.
																When	the	phone	rang	again,	Hagen	threw	his	papers	back	into	the basket.	The	hell	with	it.	He’d	leave.	It	never	occurred	to	him	to	refuse	to	take	the call,	however.	When	his	secretary	told	him	it	was	Michael	Corleone	he	picked
up	the	phone	with	pleasure.	He	had	always	liked	Mike.
																“Tom,”	Michael	Corleone	said,	“I’m	driving	down	to	the	city	with Kay	tomorrow.	There’s	something	important	I	want	to	tell	the	old	man	before Christmas.	Will	he	be	home	tomorrow	night?”
																“Sure,”	Hagen	said.	“He’s	not	going	out	of	town	until	after	Christmas. Anything	I	can	do	for	you?”
																Michael	was	as	closemouthed	as	his	father.	“No,”	he	said.	“I	guess	I’ll see	you	Christmas,	everybody	is	going	to	be	out	at	Long	Beach,	right?”
																“Right,”	Hagen	said.	He	was	amused	when	Mike	hung	up	on	him without	any	small	talk.
																He	told	his	secretary	to	call	his	wife	and	tell	her	he	would	be	home	a little	late	but	to	have	some	supper	for	him.	Outside	the	building	he	walked briskly	downtown	toward	Macy’s.	Someone	stepped	in	his	way.	To	his	surprise he	saw	it	was	Sollozzo.
																Sollozzo	took	him	by	the	arm	and	said	quietly,	“Don’t	be	frightened.	I just	want	to	talk	to	you.”	A	car	parked	at	the	curb	suddenly	had	its	door	open. Sollozzo	said	urgently,	“Get	in,	I	want	to	talk	to	you.”
																Hagen	pulled	his	arm	loose.	He	was	still	not	alarmed,	just	irritated.	“I haven’t	got	time,”	he	said.	At	that	moment	two	men	came	up	behind	him.	Hagen felt	a	sudden	weakness	in	his	legs.	Sollozzo	said	softly,	“Get	in	the	car.	If	I wanted	to	kill	you	you’d	be	dead	now.	Trust	me.”
																Without	a	shred	of	trust	Hagen	got	into	the	car.
	
																Michael	Corleone	had	lied	to	Hagen.	He	was	already	in	New	York, and	he	had	called	from	a	room	in	the	Hotel	Pennsylvania	less	than	ten	blocks
away.	When	he	hung	up	the	phone,	Kay	Adams	put	out	her	cigarette	and	said, “Mike,	what	a	good	fibber	you	are.”
																Michael	sat	down	beside	her	on	the	bed.”	All	for	you,	honey;	if	I	told my	family	we	were	in	town	we’d	have	to	go	there	right	away.	Then	we	couldn’t go	out	to	dinner,	we	couldn’t	go	to	the	theater,	and	we	couldn’t	sleep	together tonight.	Not	in	my	father’s	house,	not	when	we’re	not	married.”	He	put	his	arms around	her	and	kissed	her	gently	on	the	lips.	Her	mouth	was	sweet	and	he	gently pulled	her	down	on	the	bed.	She	closed	her	eyes,	waiting	for	him	to	make	love	to her	and	Michael	felt	an	enormous	happiness.	He	had	spent	the	war	years	fighting in	the	Pacific,	and	on	those	bloody	islands	he	had	dreamed	of	a	girl	like	Kay Adams.	Of	a	beauty	like	hers.	A	fair	and	fragile	body,	milky-skinned	and electrified	by	passion.	She	opened	her	eyes	and	then	pulled	his	head	down	to kiss	him.	They	made	love	until	it	was	time	for	dinner	and	the	theater.
																After	dinner	they	walked	past	the	brightly	lit	department	stores	full	of holiday	shoppers	and	Michael	said	to	her,	“What	shall	I	get	you	for	Christmas?”
																She	pressed	against	him.	“Just	you,”	she	said.	“Do	you	think	your father	will	approve	of	me?”
																Michael	said	gently,	“That’s	not	really	the	question.	Will	your	parents approve	of	me?”
																Kay	shrugged.	“I	don’t	care,”	she	said.
																Michael	said,	“I	even	thought	of	changing	my	name,	legally,	but	if something	happened,	that	wouldn’t	really	help.	You	sure	you	want	to	be	a Corleone?”	He	said	it	only	half-jokingly.
																“Yes,”	she	said	without	smiling.	They	pressed	against	each	other. They	had	decided	to	get	married	during	Christmas	week,	a	quiet	civil	ceremony at	City	Hall	with	just	two	friends	as	witnesses.	But	Michael	had	insisted	he	must tell	his	father.	He	had	explained	that	his	father	would	not	object	in	any	way	as long	as	it	was	not	done	in	secrecy.	Kay	was	doubtful.	She	said	she	could	not	tell her	parents	until	after	the	marriage.	“Of	course	they’ll	think	I’m	pregnant,”	she
said.	Michael	grinned.	“So	will	my	parents,”	he	said.
																What	neither	of	them	mentioned	was	the	fact	that	Michael	would	have to	cut	his	close	ties	with	his	family.	They	both	understood	that	Michael	had already	done	so	to	some	extent	and	yet	they	both	felt	guilty	about	this	fact.	They planned	to	finish	college,	seeing	each	other	weekends	and	living	together	during summer	vacations.	It	seemed	like	a	happy	life.
																The	play	was	a	musical	called	Carousel	and	its	sentimental	story	of	a braggart	thief	made	them	smile	at	each	other	with	amusement.	When	they	came out	of	the	theater	it	had	turned	cold.	Kay	snuggled	up	to	him	and	said,	“	After we’re	married,	will	you	beat	me	and	then	steal	a	star	for	a	present?”
																Michael	laughed.	“I’m	going	to	be	a	mathematics	professor,”	he	said. Then	he	asked,	“Do	you	want	something	to	eat	before	we	go	to	the	hotel?”
																Kay	shook	her	head.	She	looked	up	at	him	meaningfully.	As	always	he was	touched	by	her	eagerness	to	make	love.	He	smiled	down	at	her,	and	they kissed	in	the	cold	street.	Michael	felt	hungry,	and	he	decided	to	order sandwiches	sent	up	to	the	room.
																In	the	hotel	lobby	Michael	pushed	Kay	toward	the	newsstand	and	said, “Get	the	papers	while	I	get	the	key.”	He	had	to	wait	in	a	small	line;	the	hotel	was still	short	of	help	despite	the	end	of	the	war.	Michael	got	his	room	key	and looked	around	impatiently	for	Kay.	She	was	standing	by	the	newsstand,	staring down	at	a	newspaper	she	held	in	her	hand.	He	walked	toward	her.	She	looked	up at	him.	Her	eyes	were	filled	with	tears.	“Oh,	Mike,”	she	said,	“oh,	Mike.”	He took	the	paper	from	her	hands.	The	first	thing	he	saw	was	a	photo	of	his	father lying	in	the	street,	his	head	in	a	pool	of	blood.	A	man	was	sitting	on	the	curb weeping	like	a	child.	It	was	his	brother	Freddie.	Michael	Corleone	felt	his	body turning	to	ice.	There	was	no	grief,	no	fear,	just	cold	rage.	He	said	to	Kay,	“Go	up to	the	room.”	But	he	had	to	take	her	by	the	arm	and	lead	her	into	the	elevator. They	rode	up	together	in	silence.	In	their	room,	Michael	sat	down	on	the	bed	and opened	the	paper.	The	headlines	said,	VITO	CORLEONE	SHOT.	ALLEGED RACKET	CHIEF	CRITICALLY	WOUNDED.	OPERATED	ON	UNDER HEAVY	POLICE	GUARD.	BLOODY	MOB	WAR	FEARED.
																Michael	felt	the	weakness	in	his	legs.	He	said	to	Kay,	“He’s	not	dead, the	bastards	didn’t	kill	him.”	He	read	the	story	again.	His	father	had	been	shot	at five	in	the	afternoon.	That	meant	that	while	he	had	been	making	love	to	Kay, having	dinner,	enjoying	the	theater,	his	father	was	near	death.	Michael	felt	sick with	guilt.
																Kay	said,	“Shall	we	go	down	to	the	hospital	now?”
																Michael	shook	his	head.	“Let	me	call	the	house	first.	The	people	who did	this	are	crazy	and	now	that	the	old	man’s	still	alive	they’ll	be	desperate.	Who the	hell	knows	what	they’ll	pull	next.”
																Both	phones	in	the	Long	Beach	house	were	busy	and	it	was	almost twenty	minutes	before	Michael	could	get	through.	He	heard	Sonny’s	voice saying,	“Yeah.”
																“Sonny,	it’s	me,”	Michael	said.
																He	could	hear	the	relief	in	Sonny’s	voice,	“Jesus,	kid,	you	had	us worried.	Where	the	hell	are	you?	I’ve	sent	people	to	that	hick	town	of	yours	to see	what	happened.”
																“How’s	the	old	man?”	Michael	said.	“How	bad	is	he	hurt?”
																“Pretty	bad,”	Sonny	said...They	shot	him	five	times.	But	he’s	tough.” Sonny’s	voice	was	proud.	“The	doctors	said	he’ll	pull	through.	Listen,	kid,	I’m busy,	I	can’t	talk,	where	are	you?”
																“In	New	York,”	Michael	said...Didn’t	Tom	tell	you	I	was	coming down?”
																Sonny’s	voice	dropped	a	little.	“They’ve	snatched	Tom.	That’s	why	I was	worried	about	you.	His	wife	is	here.	She	don’t	know	and	neither	do	the cops.	I	don’t	want	them	to	know.	The	bastards	who	pulled	this	must	be	crazy.	I want	you	to	get	out	here	right	away	and	keep	your	mouth	shut.	OK?”
																“OK,”	Mike	said,	“do	you	know	who	did	it?”
																“Sure,”	Sonny	said...And	as	soon	as	Luca	Brasi	checks	in	they’re gonna	be	dead	meat.	We	still	have	all	the	horses.”
																“I’ll	be	out	in	a	hour,”	Mike	said.	“In	a	cab.”	He	hung	up.	The	papers had	been	on	the	streets	for	over	three	hours.	There	must	have	been	radio	news reports.	It	was	almost	impossible	that	Luca	hadn’t	heard	the	news.	Thoughtfully Michael	pondered	the	question.	Where	was	Luca	Brasi?	It	was	the	same	question that	Hagen	was	asking	himself	at	that	moment.	It	was	the	same	question	that	was worrying	Sonny	Corleone	out	in	Long	Beach.
															
																At	a	quarter	to	five	that	afternoon,	Don	Corleone	had	finished checking	the	papers	the	office	manager	of	his	olive	oil	company	had	prepared for	him.	He	put	on	his	jacket	and	rapped	his	knuckles	on	his	son	Freddie’s	head to	make	him	take	his	nose	out	of	the	afternoon	newspaper.	“Tell	Gatto	to	get	the car	from	the	lot,”	he	said.	“I’ll	be	ready	to	go	home	in	a	few	minutes.”
																Freddie	grunted.	“I’ll	have	to	get	it	myself.	Paulie	called	in	sick	this morning.	Got	a	cold	again.”
																Don	Corleone	looked	thoughtful	for	a	moment.	“That’s	the	third	time this	month.	I	think	maybe	you’d	better	get	a	healthier	fellow	for	this	job.	Tell Tom.”
																Fred	protested.	“Paulie’s	a	good	kid.	If	he	says	he’s	sick,	he’s	sick.	I don’t	mind	getting	the	car.”	He	left	the	office.	Don	Corleone	watched	out	the window	as	his	son	crossed	Ninth	Avenue	to	the	parking	lot.	He	stopped	to	call Hagen’s	office	but	there	was	no	answer.	He	called	the	house	at	Long	Beach	but again	there	was	no	answer.	Irritated,	he	looked	out	the	window.	His	car	was parked	at	the	curb	in	front	of	his	building.	Freddie	was	leaning	against	the fender,	arms	folded,	watching	the	throng	of	Christmas	shoppers.	Don	Corleone put	on	his	jacket.	The	office	manager	helped	him	with	his	overcoat.	Don Corleone	grunted	his	thanks	and	went	out	the	door	and	started	down	the	two
flights	of	steps.
																Out	in	the	street	the	early	winter	light	was	failing.	Freddie	leaned casually	against	the	fender	of	the	heavy	Buick.	When	he	saw	his	father	come	out of	the	building	Freddie	went	out	into	the	street	to	the	driver’s	side	of	the	car	and got	in.	Don	Corleone	was	about	to	get	in	on	the	sidewalk	side	of	the	car	when	he hesitated	and	then	turned	back	to	the	long	open	fruit	stand	near	the	corner.	This had	been	his	habit	lately,	he	loved	the	big	out-of-season	fruits,	yellow	peaches and	oranges,	that	glowed	in	their	green	boxes.	The	proprietor	sprang	to	serve him.	Don	Corleone	did	not	handle	the	fruit.	He	pointed.	The	fruit	man	disputed his	decisions	only	once,	to	show	him	that	one	of	his	choices	had	a	rotten underside.	Don	Corleone	took	the	paper	bag	in	his	left	hand	and	paid	the	man with	a	five-dollar	bill.	He	took	his	change	and,	as	he	turned	to	go	back	to	the waiting	car,	two	men	stepped	from	around	the	corner.	Don	Corleone	knew immediately	what	was	to	happen.
																The	two	men	wore	black	overcoats	and	black	hats	pulled	low	to prevent	identification	by	witnesses.	They	had	not	expected	Don	Corleone’s	alert reaction.	He	dropped	the	bag	of	fruit	and	darted	toward	the	parked	car	with startling	quickness	for	a	man	of	his	bulk.	At	the	same	time	he	shouted,	“Fredo, Fredo.”	It	was	only	then	that	the	two	men	drew	their	guns	and	fired.
																The	first	bullet	caught	Don	Corleone	in	the	back.	He	felt	the	hammer shock	of	its	impact	but	made	his	body	move	toward	the	car.	The	next	two	bullets hit	him	in	the	buttocks	and	sent	him	sprawling	in	the	middle	of	the	street. Meanwhile	the	two	gunmen,	careful	not	to	slip	on	the	rolling	fruit,	started	to follow	in	order	to	finish	him	off.	At	that	moment,	perhaps	no	more	than	five seconds	after	the	Don’s	call	to	his	son,	Frederico	Corleone	appeared	out	of	his car,	looming	over	it.	The	gunmen	fired	two	more	hasty	shots	at	the	Don	lying	in the	gutter.	One	hit	him	in	the	fleshy	part	of	his	arm	and	the	second	hit	him	in	the calf	of	his	right	leg.	Though	these	wounds	were	the	least	serious	they	bled profusely,	forming	small	pools	of	blood	beside	his	body.	But	by	this	time	Don Corleone	had	lost	consciousness.
																Freddie	had	heard	his	father	shout,	calling	him	by	his	childhood	name, and	then	he	had	heard	the	first	two	loud	reports.	By	the	time	he	got	out	of	the	car
he	was	in	shock,	he	had	not	even	drawn	his	gun.	The	two	assassins	could	easily have	shot	him	down.	But	they	too	panicked.	They	must	have	known	the	son	was armed,	and	besides	too	much	time	had	passed.	They	disappeared	around	the corner,	leaving	Freddie	alone	in	the	street	with	his	father’s	bleeding	body.	Many of	the	people	thronging	the	avenue	had	flung	themselves	into	doorways	or	on	the ground,	others	had	huddled	together	in	small	groups.
																Freddie	still	had	not	drawn	his	weapon.	He	seemed	stunned.	He	stared down	at	his	father’s	body	lying	face	down	on	the	tarred	street,	lying	now	in	what seemed	to	him	a	blackish	lake	of	blood.	Freddie	went	into	physical	shock. People	eddied	out	again	and	someone,	seeing	him	start	to	sag,	led	him	to	the curbstone	and	made	him	sit	down	on	it.	A	crowd	gathered	around	Don Corleone’s	body,	a	circle	that	shattered	when	the	first	police	car	sirened	a	path through	them.	Directly	behind	the	police	was	the	Daily	News	radio	car	and	even before	it	stopped	a	photographer	jumped	out	to	snap	pictures	of	the	bleeding Don	Corleone.	A	few	moments	later	an	ambulance	arrived.	The	photographer turned	his	attention	to	Freddie	Corleone,	who	was	now	weeping	openly,	and	this was	a	curiously	comical	sight,	because	of	his	tough,	Cupid-featured	face,	heavy nose	and	thick	mouth	smeared	with	snot.	Detectives	were	spreading	through	the crowd	and	more	police	cars	were	coming	up.	One	detective	knelt	beside	Freddie, questioning	him,	but	Freddie	was	too	deep	in	shock	to	answer.	The	detective reached	inside	Freddie’s	coat	and	lifted	his	wallet.	He	looked	at	the identification	inside	and	whistled	to	his	partner.	In	just	a	few	seconds	Freddie had	been	cut	off	from	the	crowd	by	a	flock	of	plainclothesmen.	The	first detective	found	Freddie’s	gun	in	its	shoulder	holster	and	took	it.	Then	they	lifted Freddie	off	his	feet	and	shoved	him	into	an	unmarked	car.	As	that	car	pulled away	it	was	followed	by	the	Daily	News	radio	car.	The	photographer	was	still snapping	pictures	of	everybody	and	everything.
	
																In	the	half	hour	after	the	shooting	of	his	father,	Sonny	Corleone received	five	phone	calls	in	rapid	succession.	The	first	was	from	Detective	John Phillips,	who	was	on	the	family	payroll	and	had	been	in	the	lead	car	of plainclothesmen	at	the	scene	of	the	shooting.	The	first	thing	he	said	to	Sonny over	the	phone	was,	“Do	you	recognize	my	voice?”
																“Yeah,”	Sonny	said.	He	was	fresh	from	a	nap,	called	to	the	phone	by his	wife.
																Phillips	said	quickly	without	preamble,	“Somebody	shot	your	father outside	his	place.	Fifteen	minutes	ago.	He’s	alive	but	hurt	bad.	They’ve	taken him	to	French	Hospital.	They	got	your	brother	Freddie	down	at	the	Chelsea precinct.	You	better	get	him	a	doctor	when	they	turn	him	loose.	I’m	going	down to	the	hospital	now	to	help	question	your	old	man,	if	he	can	talk.	I’ll	keep	you posted.”
																Across	the	table,	Sonny’s	wife	Sandra	noticed	that	her	husband’s	face had	gone	red	with	flushing	blood.	His	eyes	were	glazed	over.	She	whispered, “What’s	the	matter?”	He	waved	at	her	impatiently	to	shut	up,	swung	his	body away	so	that	his	back	was	toward	her	and	said	into	the	phone,	“You	sure	he’s alive?”
																“Yeah,	I’m	sure,”	the	detective	said.	“A	lot	of	blood	but	I	think	maybe he’s	not	as	bad	as	he	looks.”
																“Thanks,”	Sonny	said.	“Be	home	tomorrow	morning	eight	sharp.	You got	a	grand	coming.”
																Sonny	cradled	the	phone.	He	forced	himself	to	sit	still.	He	knew	that his	greatest	weakness	was	his	anger	and	this	was	one	time	when	anger	could	be fatal.	The	first	thing	to	do	was	get	Tom	Hagen.	But	before	he	could	pick	up	the phone,	it	rang.	The	call	was	from	the	bookmaker	licensed	by	the	Family	to operate	in	the	district	of	the	Don’s	office.	The	bookmaker	had	called	to	tell	him that	the	Don	had	been	killed,	shot	dead	in	the	street.	After	a	few	questions	to make	sure	that	the	bookmaker’s	informant	had	not	been	close	to	the	body,	Sonny dismissed	the	information	as	incorrect.	Phillips’	dope	would	be	more	accurate. The	phone	rang	almost	immediately	a	third	time.	It	was	a	reporter	from	the	Daily News.	As	soon	as	he	identified	himself,	Sonny	Corleone	hung	up.
																He	dialed	Hagen’s	house	and	asked	Hagen’s	wife,	“Did	Tom	come home	yet?”	She	said,	“No,”	that	he	was	not	due	for	another	twenty	minutes	but she	expected	him	home	for	supper.	“Have	him	call	me,”	Sonny	said.
