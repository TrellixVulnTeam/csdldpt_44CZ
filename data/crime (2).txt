had	saved	for	himself.	It	was	strictly	a	one-night	stand	and	she	came	after	me. What	the	hell	could	I	do?	Then	my	whore	second	wife	throws	me	out.	And Ginny	and	the	kids	won’t	take	me	back	unless	I	come	crawling	on	my	hands	and knees,	and	I	can’t	sing	anymore.	Godfather,	what	the	hell	can	I	do?”
																Don	Corleone’s	face	had	become	cold	without	a	hint	of	sympathy.	He said	contemptuously,	“You	can	start	by	acting	like	a	man.”	Suddenly	anger contorted	his	face.	He	shouted.	“LIKE	A	MAN!”	He	reached	over	the	desk	and grabbed	Johnny	Fontane	by	the	hair	of	his	head	in	a	gesture	that	was	savagely affectionate.	“By	Christ	in	heaven,	is	it	possible	that	you	spent	so	much	time	in my	presence	and	turned	out	no	better	than	this?	A	Hollywood	finocchio	who weeps	and	begs	for	pity?	Who	cries	out	like	a	woman--’What	shall	I	do?	Oh, what	shall	I	do?’”
																The	mimicry	of	the	Don	was	so	extraordinary,	so	unexpected,	that Hagen	and	Johnny	were	startled	into	laughter.	Don	Corleone	was	pleased.	For	a moment	he	reflected	on	how	much	he	loved	this	godson.	How	would	his	own three	sons	have	reacted	to	such	a	tongue-lashing?	Santino	would	have	sulked	and behaved	badly	for	weeks	afterward.	Fredo	would	have	been	cowed.	Michael would	have	given	him	a	cold	smile	and	gone	out	of	the	house,	not	to	be	seen	for months.	But	Johnny,	ah,	what	a	fine	chap	he	was,	smiling	now,	gathering strength,	knowing	already	the	true	purpose	of	his	Godfather.
																Don	Corleone	went	on.	“You	took	the	woman	of	your	boss,	a	man more	powerful	than	yourself,	then	you	complain	he	won’t	help	you.	What nonsense.	You	left	your	family,	your	children	without	a	father,	to	marry	a	whore and	you	weep	because	they	don’t	welcome	you	back	with	open	arms.	The whore,	you	don’t	hit	her	in	the	face	because	she	is	making	a	picture,	then	you	are amazed	because	she	laughs	at	you.	You	lived	like	a	fool	and	you	have	come	to	a fool’s	end.”
																Don	Corleone	paused	to	ask	in	a	patient	voice,	“	Are	you	willing	to take	my	advice	this	time?”
																Johnny	Fontane	shrugged.	“I	can’t	marry	Ginny	again,	not	the	way	she wants.	I	have	to	gamble,	I	have	to	drink,	I	have	to	go	out	with	the	boys.
Beautiful	broads	run	after	me	and	I	never	could	resist	them.	Then	I	used	to	feel like	a	heel	when	I	went	back	to	Ginny.	Christ,	I	can’t	go	through	all	that	crap again.”
																It	was	rare	that	Don	Corleone	showed	exasperation.	“I	didn’t	tell	you to	get	married	again.	Do	what	you	want.	It’s	good	you	wish	to	be	a	father	to	your children.	A	man	who	is	not	a	father	to	his	children	can	never	be	a	real	man.	But then,	you	must	make	their	mother	accept	you.	Who	says	you	can’t	see	them every	day?	Who	says	you	can’t	live	in	the	same	house?	Who	says	you	can’t	live your	life	exactly	as	you	want	to	live	it?”
																Johnny	Fontane	laughed.	“Godfather,	not	all	women	are	like	the	old Italian	wives.	Ginny	won’t	stand	for	it.”
																Now	the	Don	was	mocking.	“Because	you	acted	like	a	finocchio.	You gave	her	more	than	the	court	said.	You	didn’t	hit	the	other	in	the	face	because she	was	making	a	picture.	You	let	women	dictate	your	actions	and	they	are	not competent	in	this	world,	though	certainly	they	will	be	saints	in	heaven	while	we men	burn	in	hell.	And	then	I’ve	watched	you	all	these	years.”	The	Don’s	voice became	earnest.	“You’ve	been	a	fine	godson,	you’ve	given	me	all	the	respect. But	what	of	your	other	old	friends?	One	year	you	run	around	with	this	person, the	next	year	with	another	person.	That	Italian	boy	who	was	so	funny	in	the movies,	he	had	some	bad	luck	and	you	never	saw	him	again	because	you	were more	famous.	And	how	about	your	old,	old	comrade	that	you	went	to	school with,	who	was	your	partner	singing?	Nino.	He	drinks	too	much	out	of disappointment	but	he	never	complains.	He	works	hard	driving	the	gravel	truck and	sings	weekends	for	a	few	dollars.	He	never	says	anything	against	you.	You couldn’t	help	him	a	bit?	Why	not?	He	sings	well.”
																Johnny	Fontane	said	with	patient	weariness,	“Godfather,	he	just	hasn’t got	enough	talent.	He’s	OK,	but	he’s	not	big	time.”
																Don	Corleone	lidded	his	eyes	almost	closed	and	then	said,	“And	you, godson,	you	now,	you	just	don’t	have	talent	enough.	Shall	I	get	you	a	job	on	the gravel	truck	with	Nino?”	When	Johnny	didn’t	answer,	the	Don	went	on. “Friendship	is	everything.	Friendship	is	more	than	talent.	It	is	more	than
government.	It	is	almost	the	equal	of	family.	Never	forget	that.	If	you	had	built up	a	wall	of	friendships	you	wouldn’t	have	to	ask	me	to	help.	Now	tell	me,	why can’t	you	sing?	You	sang	well	in	the	garden.	As	well	as	Nino.”
																Hagen	and	Johnny	smiled	at	this	delicate	thrust.	It	was	Johnny’s	turn to	be	patronizingly	patient.	“My	voice	is	weak.	I	sing	one	or	two	songs	and	then I	can’t	sing	again	for	hours	or	days.	I	can’t	make	it	through	the	rehearsals	or	the retakes.	My	voice	is	weak,	it’s	got	some	sort	of	sickness.”
																“So	you	have	woman	trouble.	Your	voice	is	sick.	Now	tell	me	the trouble	you’re	having	with	this	Hollywood	pezzonovante	who	won’t	let	you work.”	The	Don	was	getting	down	to	business.
																“He’s	bigger	than	one	of	your	pezzonovantes,	“	Johnny	said.	“He	owns the	studio.	He	advises	the	President	on	movie	propaganda	for	the	war.	Just	a month	ago	he	bought	the	movie	rights	to	the	biggest	novel	of	the	year.	A	best seller.	And	the	main	character	is	a	guy	just	like	me.	I	wouldn’t	even	have	to	act, just	be	myself.	I	wouldn’t	even	have	to	sing.	I	might	even	win	the	Academy Award.	Everybody	knows	it’s	perfect	for	me	and	I’d	be	big	again.	As	an	actor. But	that	bastard	Jack	Woltz	is	paying	me	off,	he	won’t	give	it	to	me.	I	offered	to do	it	for	nothing,	for	a	minimum	price	and	he	still	says	no.	He	sent	the	word	that if	I	come	and	kiss	his	ass	in	the	studio	commissary,	maybe	he’ll	think	about	it.”
																Don	Corleone	dismissed	this	emotional	nonsense	with	a	wave	of	his hand.	Among	reasonable	men	problems	of	business	could	always	be	solved.	He patted	his	godson	on	the	shoulder.	“You’re	discouraged.	Nobody	cares	about you,	so	you	think.	And	you’ve	lost	a	lot	of	weight.	You	drink	a	lot,	eh?	You don’t	sleep	and	you	take	pills?”	He	shook	his	head	disapprovingly.
																“Now	I	want	you	to	follow	my	orders,”	the	Don	said.	“I	want	you	to stay	in	my	house	for	one	month.	I	want	you	to	eat	well,	to	rest	and	sleep.	I	want you	to	be	my	companion,	I	enjoy	your	company,	and	maybe	you	can	learn something	about	the	world	from	your	Godfather	that	might	even	help	you	in	the great	Hollywood.	But	no	singing,	no	drinking	and	no	women.	At	the	end	of	the month	you	can	go	back	to	Hollywood	and	this	pezzonovante,	this	.90	caliber	will give	you	that	job	you	want.	Done?”
																Johnny	Fontane	could	not	altogether	believe	that	the	Don	had	such power.	But	his	Godfather	had	never	said	such	and	such	a	thing	could	be	done without	having	it	done.	“This	guy	is	a	personal	friend	of	J.	Edgar	Hoover,” Johnny	said.	“You	can’t	even	raise	your	voice	to	him.”
																“He’s	a	businessman,”	the	Don	said	blandly.	“I’ll	make	him	an	offer he	can’t	refuse.”
																“It’s	too	late,”	Johnny	said.”	All	the	contracts	have	been	signed	and they	start	shooting	in	a	week.	It’s	absolutely	impossible.”
																Don	Corleone	said,	“Go,	go	back	to	the	party.	Your	friends	are	waiting for	you.	Leave	everything	to	me.”	He	pushed	Johnny	Fontane	out	of	the	room.
																Hagen	sat	behind	the	desk,	and	made	notes.	The	Don	heaved	a	sigh and	asked,	“Is	there	anything	else?”
																“Sollozzo	can’t	be	put	off	any	more.	You’ll	have	to	see	him	this week.”	Hagen	held	his	pen	over	the	calendar.
																The	Don	shrugged.	“Now	that	the	wedding	is	over,	whenever	you like.”
																This	answer	told	Hagen	two	things.	Most	important,	that	the	answer	to Virgil	Sollozzo	would	be	no.	The	second,	that	Don	Corleone,	since	he	would	not give	the	answer	before	his	daughter’s	wedding,	expected	his	no	to	cause	trouble.
																Hagen	said	cautiously,	“Shall	I	tell	Clemenza	to	have	some	men	come live	in	the	house?”
																The	Don	said	impatiently,	“For	what?	I	didn’t	answer	before	the wedding	because	on	an	important	day	like	that	there	should	be	no	cloud,	not even	in	the	distance.	Also	I	wanted	to	know	beforehand	what	he	wanted	to	talk about.	We	know	now.	What	he	will	propose	is	an	infamita.”
																Hagen	asked,	“Then	you	will	refuse?”	When	the	Don	nodded,	Hagen said,	“I	think	we	should	all	discuss	it--the	whole	Family--before	you	give	your answer.”
																The	Don	smiled.	“You	think	so?	Good,	we	will	discuss	it.	When	you come	back	from	California.	I	want	you	to	fly	there	tomorrow	and	settle	this business	for	Johnny.	See	that	movie	pezzonovante.	Tell	Sollozzo	I	will	see	him when	you	get	back	from	California.	Is	there	anything	else?”
																Hagen	said	formally,	“The	hospital	called.	Consigliere	Abbandando	is dying,	he	won’t	last	out	the	night.	His	family	was	told	to	come	and	wait.”
																Hagen	had	filled	the	Consigliere’s	post	for	the	past	year,	ever	since	the cancer	had	imprisoned	Genco	Abbandando	in	his	hospital	bed.	Now	he	waited	to hear	Don	Corleone	say	the	post	was	his	permanently.	The	odds	were	against	it. So	high	a	position	was	traditionally	given	only	to	a	man	descended	from	two Italian	parents.	There	had	already	been	trouble	about	his	temporary	performance of	the	duties.	Also,	he	was	only	thirty-five,	not	old	enough,	supposedly,	to	have acquired	the	necessary	experience	and	cunning	for	a	successful	Consigliere.
																But	the	Don	gave	him	no	encouragement.	He	asked,	“When	does	my daughter	leave	with	her	bridegroom?”
																Hagen	looked	at	his	wristwatch.	“In	a	few	minutes	they’ll	cut	the	cake and	then	a	half	hour	after	that.”	That	reminded	him	of	something	else.	“Your new	son-in-law.	Do	we	give	him	something	important,	inside	the	Family?”
																He	was	surprised	at	the	vehemence	of	the	Don’s	answer.	“Never.”	The Don	hit	the	desk	with	the	flat	of	his	hand.	“Never.	Give	him	something	to	earn his	living,	a	good	living.	But	never	let	him	know	the	Family’s	business.	Tell	the others,	Sonny,	Fredo,	Clemenza.”
																The	Don	paused.	“Instruct	my	sons,	all	three	of	them,	that	they	will accompany	me	to	the	hospital	to	see	poor	Genco.	I	want	them	to	pay	their	last respects.	Tell	Freddie	to	drive	the	big	car	and	ask	Johnny	if	he	will	come	with us,	as	a	special	favor	to	me.”	He	saw	Hagen	look	at	him	questioningly.	“I	want
you	to	go	to	California	tonight.	You	won’t	have	time	to	go	see	Genco.	But	don’t leave	until	I	come	back	from	the	hospital	and	speak	with	you.	Understood?”
																“Understood,”	Hagen	said.	“What	time	should	Fred	have	the	car waiting?”
																“When	the	guests	have	left,”	Don	Corleone	said.	“Genco	will	wait	for me.”
																“The	Senator	called,”	Hagen	said.”	Apologizing	for	not	coming personally	but	that	you	would	understand.	He	probably	means	those	two	FBI men	across	the	street	taking	down	license	numbers.	But	he	sent	his	gift	over	by special	messenger.”
																The	Don	nodded.	He	did	not	think	it	necessary	to	mention	that	he himself	had	warned	the	Senator	not	to	come.	“Did	he	send	a	nice	present?”
																Hagen	made	a	face	of	impressed	approval	that	was	very	strangely Italian	on	his	German-Irish	features.”	Antique	silver,	very	valuable.	The	kids	can sell	it	for	a	grand	at	least.	The	Senator	spent	a	lot	of	time	getting	exactly	the	right thing.	For	those	kind	of	people	that’s	more	important	than	how	much	it	costs.”
																Don	Corleone	did	not	hide	his	pleasure	that	so	great	a	man	as	the Senator	had	shown	him	such	respect.	The	Senator,	like	Luca	Brasi,	was	one	of the	great	stones	in	the	Don’s	power	structure,	and	he	too,	with	this	gift,	had resworn	his	loyalty.
	
																When	Johnny	Fontane	appeared	in	the	garden,	Kay	Adams	recognized him	immediately.	She	was	truly	surprised.	“You	never	told	me	your	family	knew Johnny	Fontane,”	she	said.	“Now	I’m	sure	I’ll	marry	you.”
																“Do	you	want	to	meet	him?”	Michael	asked.	“Not	now,”	Kay	said.	She sighed.	“I	was	in	love	with	him	for	three	years.	I	used	to	come	down	to	New
York	whenever	he	sang	at	the	Capitol	and	scream	my	head	off.	He	was	so wonderful.”
																“We’ll	meet	him	later,”	Michael	said.
																When	Johnny	finished	singing	and	vanished	into	the	house	with	Don Corleone,	Kay	said	archly	to	Michael,	“Don’t	tell	me	a	big	movie	star	like Johnny	Fontane	has	to	ask	your	father	for	a	favor?”
																“He’s	my	father’s	godson,”	Michael	said.”	And	if	it	wasn’t	for	my father	he	might	not	be	a	big	movie	star	today.”
																Kay	Adams	laughed	with	delight.	“That	sounds	like	another	great story.”
																Michael	shook	his	head.	“I	can’t	tell	that	one,”	he	said.
																“Trust	me,”	she	said.
																He	told	her.	He	told	her	without	being	funny.	He	told	it	without	pride. He	told	it	without	any	sort	of	explanation	except	that	eight	years	before	his father	had	been	more	impetuous,	and	because	the	matter	concerned	his	godson, the	Don	considered	it	an	affair	of	personal	honor.
																The	story	was	quickly	told.	Eight	years	ago	Johnny	Fontane	had	made an	extraordinary	success	singing	with	a	popular	dance	band.	He	had	become	a top	radio	attraction.	Unfortunately	the	band	leader,	a	well	known	show	business personality	named	Les	Halley,	had	signed	Johnny	to	a	five-year	personal services	contract.	It	was	a	common	show	business	practice.	Les	Halley	could now	loan	Johnny	out	and	pocket	most	of	the	money.
																Don	Corleone	entered	the	negotiations	personally.	He	offered	Les Halley	twenty	thousand	dollars	to	release	Johnny	Fontane	from	the	personal services	contract.	Halley	offered	to	take	only	fifty	percent	of	Johnny’s	earnings. Don	Corleone	was	amused.	He	dropped	his	offer	from	twenty	thousand	dollars
to	ten	thousand	dollars.	The	band	leader,	obviously	not	a	man	of	the	world outside	his	beloved	show	business,	completely	missed	the	significance	of	this lower	offer.	He	refused.
																The	next	day	Don	Corleone	went	to	see	the	band	leader	personally.	He brought	with	him	his	two	best	friends,	Genco	Abbandando,	who	was	his Consigliere,	and	Luca	Brasi.	With	no	other	witnesses	Don	Corleone	persuaded Les	Halley	to	sign	a	document	giving	up	all	rights	to	all	services	from	Johnny Fontane	upon	payment	of	a	certified	check	to	the	amount	of	ten	thousand	dollars. Don	Corleone	did	this	by	putting	a	pistol	to	the	forehead	of	the	band	leader	and assuring	him	with	the	utmost	seriousness	that	either	his	signature	or	his	brains would	rest	on	that	document	in	exactly	one	minute.	Les	Halley	signed.	Don Corleone	pocketed	his	pistol	and	handed	over	the	certified	check.
																The	rest	was	history.	Johnny	Fontane	went	on	to	become	the	greatest singing	sensation	in	the	country.	He	made	Hollywood	musicals	that	earned	a fortune	for	his	studio.	His	records	made	millions	of	dollars.	Then	he	divorced	his childhood-sweetheart	wife	and	left	his	two	children,	to	marry	the	most glamorous	blond	star	in	motion	pictures.	He	soon	learned	that	she	was	a “whore.”	He	drank,	he	gambled,	he	chased	other	wo		vi	He	lost	his	singing voice.	His	records	stopped	selling.	The	studio	did	not	renew	his	contract.	And	so now	he	had	come	back	to	his	Godfather.
																Kay	said	thoughtfully,	“	Are	you	sure	you’re	not	jealous	of	your father?	Everything	you’ve	told	me	about	him	shows	him	doing	something	for other	people.	He	must	be	goodhearted.”	She	smiled	wryly.	“Of	course	his methods	are	not	exactly	constitutional.”
																Michael	sighed.	“I	guess	that’s	the	way	it	sounds,	but	let	me	tell	you this.	You	know	those	Arctic	explorers	who	leave	caches	of	food	scattered	on	the route	to	the	North	Pole?	Just	in	case	they	may	need	them	someday?	That’s	my father’s	favors.	Someday	he’ll	be	at	each	one	of	those	people’s	houses	and	they had	better	come	across.”
	
																It	was	nearly	twilight	before	the	wedding	cake	was	shown,	exclaimed over	and	eaten.	Specially	baked	by	Nazorine,	it	was	cleverly	decorated	with shells	of	cream	so	dizzyingly	delicious	that	the	bride	greedily	plucked	them	from the	corpse	of	the	cake	before	she	whizzed	away	on	her	honeymoon	with	her blond	groom.	The	Don	politely	sped	his	guests’	departure,	noting	meanwhile that	the	black	sedan	with	its	FBI	men	was	no	longer	visible.
																Finally	the	only	car	left	in	the	driveway	was	the	long	black	Cadillac with	Freddie	at	the	wheel.	The	Don	got	into	the	front	seat,	moving	with	quick coordination	for	his	age	and	bulk.	Sonny,	Michael	and	Johnny	Fontane	got	into the	back	seat.	Don	Corleone	said	to	his	son	Michael,	“Your	girl	friend,	she’ll	get back	to	the	city	by	herself	all	right?”
																Michael	nodded.	“Tom	said	he’d	take	care	of	it.”	Don	Corleone nodded	with	satisfaction	at	Hagen’s	efficiency.
																Because	of	the	gas	rationing	still	in	effect,	there	was	little	traffic	on	the Belt	Parkway	to	Manhattan.	In	less	than	an	hour	the	Cadillac	rolled	into	the street	of	French	Hos0000l.	During	the	ride	Don	Corleone	asked	his	youngest	son if	he	was	doing	well	in	school.	Michael	nodded.	Then	Sonny	in	the	back	seat asked	his	father,	“Johnny	says	you’re	getting	him	squared	away	with	that Hollywood	business.	Do	you	want	me	to	go	out	there	and	help?”
																Don	Corleone	was	curt.	“Tom	is	going	tonight.	He	won’t	need	any help,	it’s	a	simple	affair.”
																Sonny	Corleone	laughed.	“Johnny	thinks	you	can’t	fix	it,	that’s	why	I thought	you	might	want	me	to	go	out	there.”
																Don	Corleone	turned	his	head.	“Why	do	you	doubt	me?”	he	asked Johnny	Fontane.	“Hasn’t	your	Godfather	always	done	what	he	said	he	would	do? Have	I	ever	been	taken	for	a	fool?”
																Johnny	apologized	nervously.	“Godfather,	the	man	who	runs	it	is	a real	.90	caliber	pezzonovante.	You	can’t	budge	him,	not	even	with	money.	He has	big	connections.	And	he	hates	me.	I	just	don’t	know	how	you	can	swing	it.”
																The	Don	spoke	with	affectionate	amusement.	“I	say	to	you:	you	shall have	it.”	He	nudged	Michael	with	his	elbow.	“We	won’t	disappoint	my	godson, eh,	Michael?”
																Michael,	who	never	doubted	his	father	for	a	moment,	shook	his	head.
																As	they	walked	toward	the	hospital	entrance,	Don	Corleone	put	his hand	on	Michael’s	arm	so	that	the	others	forged	ahead.	“When	you	get	through with	college,	come	and	talk	to	me,”	the	Don	said.	“I	have	some	plans	you	will like.”
																Michael	didn’t	say	anything.	Don	Corleone	grunted	in	exasperation.	“I know	how	you	are.	I	won’t	ask	you	to	do	anything	you	don’t	approve	of.	This	is something	special.	Go	your	own	way	now,	you’re	a	man	after	all.	But	come	to me	as	a	son	should	when	you	have	finished	with	your	schooling.”
	
																The	family	of	Genco	Abbandando,	wife	and	three	daughters	dressed	in black,	clustered	like	a	flock	of	plump	crows	on	the	white	tile	floor	of	the	hospital corridor.	When	they	saw	Don	Corleone	come	out	of	the	elevator,	they	seemed	to flutter	up	off	the	white	tiles	in	an	instinctive	surge	toward	him	for	protection. The	mother	was	regally	stout	in	black,	the	daughters	fat	and	plain.	Mrs. Abbandando	pecked	at	Don	Corleone’s	cheek,	sobbing,	wailing,	“Oh,	what	a saint	you	are,	to	come	here	on	your	daughter’s	wedding	day.”
																Don	Corleone	brushed	these	thanks	aside.	“Don’t	I	owe	respect	to	such a	friend,	a	friend	who	has	been	my	right	arm	for	twenty	years?”	He	had understood	immediately	that	the	soon-to-be	widow	did	not	comprehend	that	her husband	would	die	this	night.	Genco	Abbandando	had	been	in	this	hospital	for nearly	a	year	dying	of	his	cancer	and	the	wife	had	come	to	consider	his	fatal illness	almost	an	ordinary	part	of	life.	Tonight	was	just	another	crisis.	She babbled	on.	“Go	in	and	see	my	poor	husband,”	she	said,	“he	asks	for	you.	Poor man,	he	wanted	to	come	to	the	wedding	to	show	his	respect	but	the	doctor	would not	permit	it.	Then	he	said	you	would	come	to	see	him	on	this	great	day	but	I	did not	believe	it	possible.	Ah,	men	understand	friendship	more	than	we	women.	Go
