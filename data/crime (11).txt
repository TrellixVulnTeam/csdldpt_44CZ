him.	I’m	sure	most	of	it’s	not	true.”
																Michael	said	politely,	“I	don’t	think	so	either.”	He	was	surprised	to find	himself	so	secretive	with	Kay.	He	loved	her,	he	trusted	her,	but	he	would never	tell	her	anything	about	his	father	or	the	Family.	She	was	an	outsider.
																“What	about	you?”	Kay	asked.	“Are	you	going	to	get	mixed	up	in	this gang	war	the	papers	are	talking	about	so	gleefully?”
																Michael	grinned,	unbuttoned	his	jacket	and	held	it	wide	open.	“Look, no	guns,”	he	said.	Kay	laughed.
																It	was	getting	late	and	they	went	up	to	their	room.	She	mixed	a	drink for	both	of	them	and	sat	on	his	lap	as	they	drank.	Beneath	her	dress	she	was	all silk	until	his	hand	touched	the	glowing	skin	of	her	thigh.	They	fell	back	on	the bed	together	and	made	love	with	all	their	clothes	on,	their	mouths	glued together.	When	they	were	finished	they	lay	very	still,	feeling	the	heat	of	their bodies	burning	through	their	garments.	Kay	murmured,	“Is	that	what	you soldiers	call	a	quickie?”
																“Yeah,”	Michael	said.
																“It’s	not	bad,”	Kay	said	in	a	judicious	voice.
																They	dozed	off	until	Michael	suddenly	started	up	anxiously	and looked	at	his	watch.	“Damn,”	he	said.	“It’s	nearly	ten.	I	have	to	get	down	to	the hospital.”	He	went	to	the	bathroom	to	wash	up	and	comb	his	hair.	Kay	came	in after	him	and	put	her	arms	around	his	waist	from	behind.	“When	are	we	going	to get	married?”	she	asked.
																“Whenever	you	say,	“	Michael	said.	“As	soon	as	this	family	thing quiets	down	and	my	old	man	gets	better.	I	think	you’d	better	explain	things	to your	parents	though.”
																“What	should	I	explain?”	Kay	said	quietly.
																Michael	ran	the	comb	through	his	hair...Just	say	that	you’ve	met	a brave,	handsome	guy	of	Italian	descent.	Top	marks	at	Dartmouth.	Distinguished Service	Cross	during	the	war	plus	the	Purple	Heart.	Honest.	Hard-working.	But his	father	is	a	Mafia	chief	who	has	to	kill	bad	people,	sometimes	bribe	high government	officials	and	in	his	line	of	work	gets	shot	full	of	holes	himself.	But that	has	nothing	to	do	with	his	honest	hard-working	son.	Do	you	think	you	can remember	all	that?”
																Kay	let	go	his	body	and	leaned	against	the	door	of	the	bathroom.	“Is he	really?”	she	said.	“Does	he	really?”	She	paused.	“Kill	people?”
																Michael	finished	combing	his	hair.	“I	don’t	really	know,”	he said...Nobody	really	knows.	But	I	wouldn’t	be	surprised.”
																Before	he	went	out	the	door	she	asked,	“When	will	I	see	you	again?”
																Michael	kissed	her.	“I	want	you	to	go	home	and	think	things	over	in that	little	hick	town	of	yours,”	he	said.	“I	don’t	want	you	to	get	mixed	up	in	this business	in	any	way.	After	the	Christmas	holidays	I’ll	be	back	at	school	and we’ll	get	together	up	in	Hanover.	OK?”
																“OK,”	she	said.	She	watched	him	go	out	the	door,	saw	him	wave before	he	stepped	into	the	elevator.	She	had	never	felt	so	close	to	him,	never	so much	in	love	and	if	someone	had	told	her	she	would	not	see	Michael	again	until three	years	passed,	she	would	not	have	been	able	to	bear	the	anguish	of	it.
	
																When	Michael	got	out	of	the	cab	in	front	of	the	French	Hospital	he was	surprised	to	see	that	the	street	was	completely	deserted.	When	he	entered	the hospital	he	was	even	more	surprised	to	find	the	lobby	empty.	Damn	it,	what	the hell	were	Clemenza	and	Tessio	doing?	Sure,	they	never	went	to	West	Point	but they	knew	enough	about	tactics	to	have	outposts.	A	couple	of	their	men	should have	been	in	the	lobby	at	least.
																Even	the	latest	visitors	had	departed,	it	was	almost	ten-thirty	at	night.
Michael	was	tense	and	alert	now.	He	didn’t	bother	to	stop	at	the”	information desk,	he	already	knew	his	father’s	room	number	up	on	the	fourth	floor.	He	took the	self-service	elevator.	Oddly	enough	nobody	stopped	him	until	he	reached	the nurses’	station	on	the	fourth	floor.	But	he	strode	right	past	her	query	and	on	to his	father’s	room.	There	was	no	one	outside	the	door.	Where	the	hell	were	the two	detectives	who	were	supposed	to	be	waiting	around	to	guard	and	question the	old	man?	Where	the	hell	were	Tessio	and	Clemenza’s	people?	Could	there be	someone	inside	the	room?	But	the	door	was	open.	Michael	went	in.	There was	a	figure	in	the	bed	and	by	the	December	moonlight	straining	through	the window	Michael	could	see	his	father’s	face.	Even	now	it	was	impassive,	the chest	heaved	shallowly	with	his	uneven	breath.	Tubes	hung	from	steel	gallows beside	the	bed	and	ran	into	his	nose.	On	the	floor	was	a	glass	jar	receiving	the poisons	emptied	from	his	stomach	by	other	tubes.	Michael	stayed	there	for	a	few moments	to	make	sure	his	father	was	all	right,	then	backed	out	of	the	room.
																He	told	the	nurse,	“My	name	is	Michael	Corleone,	I	just	want	to	sit with	my	father.	What	happened	to	the	detectives	who	were	supposed	to	be guarding	him?”
																The	nurse	was	a	pretty	young	thing	with	a	great	deal	of	confidence	in the	power	of	her	office.	“Oh,	your	father	just	had	too	many	visitors,	it	interfered with	the	hospital	service,”	she	said.	“The	police	came	and	made	them	all	leave about	ten	minutes	ago.	And	then	just	five	minutes	ago	I	had	to	call	the	detectives to	the	phone	for	an	emergency	alarm	from	their	headquarters,	and	then	they	left too.	But	don’t	worry,	I	look	in	on	your	father	often	and	I	can	hear	any	sound from	his	room.	That’s	why	we	leave	the	doors	open.”
																“Thank	you,”	Michael	said.	“I’ll	sit	with	him	for	a	little	while.	OK?”
																She	smiled	at	him.	“Just	for	a	little	bit	and	then	I’m	afraid	you’ll	have to	leave.	It’s	the	rules,	you	know.”
																Michael	went	back	into	his	father’s	room.	He	took	the	phone	from	its cradle	and	got	the	hospital	operator	to	give	him	the	house	in	Long	Beach,	the phone	in	the	corner	office	room.	Sonny	answered.	Michael	whispered,	“Sonny, I’m	down	at	the	hospital,	I	came	down	late.	Sonny,	there’s	nobody	here.	None	of
Tessio’s	people.	No	detectives	at	the	door.	The	old	man	was	completely unprotected.”	His	voice	was	trembling.
																There	was	a	long	silence	and	then	Sonny’s	voice	came,	low	and impressed,	“This	is	Sollozzo’s	move	you	were	talking	about.”
																Michael	said,	“That’s	what	I	figured	too.	But	how	did	he	get	the	cops to	clear	everybody	out	and	where	did	they	go?	What	happened	to	Tessio’s	men? Jesus	Christ,	has	that	bastard	Sollozzo	got	the	New	York	Police	Department	in his	pocket	too?”
																“Take	it	easy,	kid.”	Sonny’s	voice	was	soothing.	“We	got	lucky	again with	you	going	to	visit	the	hospital	so	late.	Stay	in	the	old	man’s	room.	Lock	the door	from	the	inside.	I’ll	have	some	men	there	inside	of	fifteen	minutes,	soon	as I	make	some	calls.	Just	sit	tight	and	don’t	panic.	OK,	kid?”
																“I	won’t	panic,”	Michael	said.	For	the	first	time	since	it	had	all	started he	felt	a	furious	anger	rising	in	him,	a	cold	hatred	for	his	father’s	enemies.
																He	hung	up	the	phone	and	rang	the	buzzer	for	the	nurse.	He	decided	to use	his	own	judgment	and	disregard	Sonny’s	orders.	When	the	nurse	came	in	he said,	“I	don’t	want	you	to	get	frightened,	but	we	have	to	move	my	father	right away.	To	another	room	or	another	floor.	Can	you	disconnect	all	these	tubes	so we	can	wheel	the	bed	out?”
																The	nurse	said,	“That’s	ridiculous.	We	have	to	get	permission	from	the doctor.”
																Michael	spoke	very	quickly.	“You’ve	read	about	my	father	in	the papers.	You’ve	seen	that	there’s	no	one	here	tonight	to	guard	him.	Now	I’ve	just gotten	word	some	men	will	come	into	the	hospital	to	kill	him.	Please	believe	me and	help	me.”	He	could	be	extraordinarily	persuasive	when	he	wanted	to	be.
																The	nurse	said,	“We	don’t	have	to	disconnect	the	tubes.	We	can	wheel the	stand	with	the	bed.”
																“Do	you	have	an	empty	room?”	Michael	whispered”	At	the	end	of	the hall,”	the	nurse	said.
																It	was	done	in	a	matter	of	moments,	very	quickly	and	very	efficiently. Then	Michael	said	to	the	nurse,	“Stay	here	with	him	until	help	comes.	If	you’re outside	at	your	station	you	might	get	hurt.”
																At	that	moment	he	heard	his	father’s	voice	from	the	bed,	hoarse	but full	of	strength,	“Michael,	is	it	you?	What	happened,	what	is	it?”
																Michael	leaned	over	the	bed.	He	took	his	father’s	hand	in	his.	“It’s Mike,”	he	said.	“Don’t	be	afraid.	Now	listen,	don’t	make	any	noise	at	all, especially	if	somebody	calls	out	your	name.	Some	people	want	to	kill	you, understand?	But	I’m	here	so	don’t	be	afraid.”
																Don	Corleone,	still	not	fully	conscious	of	what	had	happened	to	him the	day	before,	in	terrible	pain,	yet	smiled	benevolently	on	his	youngest	son, wanting	to	tell	him,	but	it	was	too	much	effort,	“Why	should	I	be	afraid	now? Strange	men	have	come	to	kill	me	ever	since	I	was	twelve	years	old.”
	
Chapter	10
	
																The	hospital	was	small	and	private	with	just	one	entrance.	Michael looked	through	the	window	down	into	the	street.	There	was	a	curved	courtyard that	had	steps	leading	down	into	the	street	and	the	street	was	empty	of	cars.	But whoever	came	into	the	hospital	would	have	to	come	through	that	entrance.	He knew	he	didn’t	have	much	time	so	he	ran	out	of	the	room	and	down	the	four flights	and	through	the	wide	doors	of	the	ground	floor	entrance.	Off	to	the	side he	saw	the	ambulance	yard	and	there	was	no	car	there,	no	ambulances	either.
																Michael	stood	on	the	sidewalk	outside	the	hospital	and	lit	a	cigarette.
He	unbuttoned	his	coat	and	stood	in	the	light	of	a	lamppost	so	that	his	features could	be	seen.	A	young	man	was	walking	swiftly	down	from	Ninth	Avenue,	a package	under	his	arm.	The	young	man	wore	a	combat	jacket	and	had	a	heavy shock	of	black	hair.	His	face	was	familiar,	when	he	came	under	the	lamplight	but Michael	could	not	place	it.	But	the	young	man	stopped	in	front	of	him	and	put out	his	hand,	saying	in	a	heavy	Italian	accent,	“Don	Michael,	do	you	remember me?	Enzo,	the	baker’s	helper	to	Nazorine	the	Paniterra;	his	son-in-law.	Your father	saved	my	life	by	getting	the	government	to	let	me	stay	in	America.”
																Michael	shook	his	hand.	He	remembered	him	now.
																Enzo	went	on,	“I’ve	come	to	pay	my	respects	to	your	father.	Will	they let	me	into	the	hospital	so	late?”
																Michael	smiled	and	shook	his	head.	“No,	but	thanks	anyway.	I’ll	tell the	Don	you	came.”	A	car	came	roaring	down	the	street	and	Michael	was instantly	alert.	He	said	to	Enzo,	“Leave	here	quickly.	There	may	be	trouble.	You don’t	want	to	get	involved	with	the	police.”
																He	saw	the	look	of	fear	on	the	young	Italian’s	face.	Trouble	with	the police	might	mean	being	deported	or	refusal	of	citizenship.	But	the	young	man stood	fast.	He	whispered	in	Italian.	“If	there’s	trouble	I’ll	stay	to	help.	I	owe	it	to the	Godfather.”
																Michael	was	touched.	He	was	about	to	tell	the	young	man	to	go	away again,	but	then	he	thought,	why	not	let	him	stay?	Two	men	in	front	of	the hospital	might	scare	off	any	of	Sollozzo’s	crew	sent	to	do	a	job.	One	man	almost certainly	would	not.	He	gave	Enzo	a	cigarette	and	lit	it	for	him.	They	both	stood under	the	lamppost	in	the	cold	December	night.	The	yellow	panes	of	the hospital,	bisected	by	the	greens	of	Christmas	decorations,	twinkled	down	on them.	They	had	almost	finished	their	cigarettes	when	a	long	low	black	car	turned into	30th	Street	from	Ninth	Avenue	and	cruised	toward	them,	very	close	to	the curb.	It	almost	stopped.	Michael	peered	to	see	their	faces	inside,	his	body flinching	involuntarily.	The	car	seemed	about	to	stop,	then	speeded	forward. Somebody	had	recognized	him.	Michael	gave	Enzo	another	cigarette	and	noticed that	the	baker’s	hands	were	shaking.	To	his	surprise	his	own	hands	were	steady.
																They	stayed	in	the	street	smoking	for	what	was	no	more	than	ten minutes	when	suddenly	the	night	air	was	split	by	a	police	siren.	A	patrol	car made	a	screaming	turn	from	Ninth	Avenue	and	pulled	up	in	front	of	the	hospital. Two	more	squad	cars	followed	right	behind	it.	Suddenly	the	hospital entranceway	was	flooded	with	uniformed	police	and	detectives.	Michael	heaved a	sigh	of	relief.	Good	old	Sonny	must	have	gotten	through	right	away.	He	moved forward	to	meet	them.
																Two	huge,	burly	policemen	grabbed	his	arms.	Another	frisked	him.	A massive	police	captain,	gold	braid	on	his	cap,	came	up	the	steps,	his	men	parting respectfully	to	leave	a	path.	He	was	a	vigorous	man	for	his	girth	and	despite	the white	hair	that	peeked	out	of	his	cap.	His	face	was	beefy	red.	He	came	up	to Michael	and	said	harshly,	“I	thought	I	got	all	you	guinea	hoods	locked	up.	Who the	hell	are	you	and	what	are	you	doing	here?”
																One	of	the	cops	standing	beside	Michael	said,	“He’s	clean,	Captain.”
																Michael	didn’t	answer.	He	was	studying	this	police	captain,	coldly searching	his	face,	the	metallic	blue	eyes.	A	detective	in	plain	clothes	said, “That’s	Michael	Corleone,	the	Don’s	son.”
																Michael	said	quietly,	“What	happened	to	the	detectives	who	were supposed	to	be	guarding	my	father?	Who	pulled	them	off	that	detail?”
																The	police	captain	was	choleric	with	rage.	“You	fucking	hood,	who the	hell	are	you	to	tell	me	my	business?	I	pulled	them	off.	I	don’t	give	a	shit	how many	dago	gangsters	kill	each	other.	If	it	was	up	to	me,	I	wouldn’t	lift	a	finger	to keep	your	old	man	from	getting	knocked	off.	Now	get	the	hell	out	of	here.	Get out	of	this	street,	you	punk,	and	stay	out	of	this	hospital	when	it’s	not	visiting hours.”
																Michael	was	still	studying	him	intently.	He	was	not	angry	at	what	this police	captain	was	saying.	His	mind	was	racing	furiously.	Was	it	possible	that Sollozzo	had	been	in	that	first	car	and	had	seen	him	standing	in	front	of	the hospital?	Was	it	possible	that	Sollozzo	had	then	called	this	captain	and	said, “How	come	the	Corleones’	men	are	still	around	the	hospital	when	I	paid	you	to
lock	them	up?”	Was	it	possible	that	all	had	been	carefully	planned	as	Sonny	had said?	Everything	fitted	in.	Still	cool,	he	said	to	the	captain,	“I’m	not	leaving	this hospital	until	you	put	guards	around	my	father’s	room.”
																The	captain	didn’t	bother	answering.	He	said	to	the	detective	standing beside	him,	“Phil,	lock	this	punk	up.”
																The	detective	said	hesitantly,	“The	kid	is	clean,	Captain.	He’s	a	war hero	and	he’s	never	been	mixed	up	in	the	rackets.	The	papers	could	make	a stink.”
																The	captain	started	to	turn	on	the	detective,	his	face	red	with	fury.	He roared	out,	“Goddamn	it,	I	said	lock	him	up.”
																Michael,	still	thinking	clearly,	not	angry,	said	with	deliberate	malice, “How	much	is	the	Turk	paying	you	to	set	my	father	up,	Captain?”
																The	police	captain	turned	to	him.	He	said	to	the	two	burly	patrolmen, “Hold	him.”	Michael	felt	his	arms	pinned	to	his	sides.	He	saw	the	captain’s massive	fist	arching	toward	his	face.	He	tried	to	weave	away	but	the	fist	caught him	high	on	the	cheekbone.	A	grenade	exploded	in	his	skull.	His	mouth	filled with	blood	and	small	hard	bones	that	he	realized	were	his	teeth.	He	could	feel the	side	of	his	head	puff	up	as	if	it	were	filling	with	air.	His	legs	were	weightless and	he	would	have	fallen	if	the	two	policemen	had	not	held	him	up.	But	he	was still	conscious.	The	plainclothes	detective	had	stepped	in	front	of	him	to	keep	the captain	from	hitting	him	again	and	was	saying,	“Jesus	Christ,	Captain,	you	really hurt	him.”
																The	captain	said	loudly,	“I	didn’t	touch	him.	He	attacked	me	and	he fell.	Do	you	understand	that?	He	resisted	arrest.”
																Through	a	red	haze	Michael	could	see	more	cars	pulling	up	to	the curb.	Men	were	getting	out.	One	of	them	he	recognized	as	Clemenza’s	lawyer, who	was	now	speaking	to	the	police	captain,	suavely	and	surely.	“The	Corleone Family	has	hired	a	firm	of	private	detectives	to	guard	Mr.	Corleone.	These	men with	me	are	licensed	to	carry	firearms,	Captain.	If	you	arrest	them,	you’ll	have	to
appear	before	a	judge	in	the	morning	and	tell	him	why.”
																The	lawyer	glanced	at	Michael.	“Do	you	want	to	prefer	charges against	whoever	did	this	to	you?	he	asked.
																Michael	had	trouble	talking.	His	jaws	wouldn’t	come	together	but	he managed	to	mumble.	“I	slipped,”	he	said.	“I	slipped	and	fell.”	He	saw	the captain	give	him	a	triumphant	glance	and	he	tried	to	answer	that	glance	with	a smile.	At	all	costs	he	wanted	to	hide	the	delicious	icy	chilliness	that	controlled his	brain,	the	surge	of	wintry	cold	hatred	that	pervaded	his	body.	He	wanted	to give	no	warning	to	anyone	in	this	world	as	to	how	he	felt	at	this	moment.	As	the Don	would	not.	Then	he	felt	himself	carried	into	the	hospital	and	he	lost consciousness.
																When	he	woke	up	in	the	morning	he	found	that	his	jaw	had	been	wired together	and	that	four	of	his	teeth	along	the	left	side	of	his	mouth	were	missing. Hagen	was	sitting	beside	his	bed.
																“Did	they	drug	me	up?”	Michael	asked.
																“Yeah,”	Hagen	said.	“They	had	to	dig	some	bone	fragments	out	of your	gums	and	they	figured	it	would	be	too	painful.	Besides	you	were	practically out	anyway.”
																“Is	there	anything	else	wrong	with	me?”	Michael	asked.
																“No,”	Hagen	said.	“Sonny	wants	you	out	at	the	Long	Beach	house. Think	you	can	make	it?”
																“Sure,”	Michael	said.	“Is	the	Don	all	right?”
																Hagen	flushed.	“I	think	we’ve	solved	the	problem	now.	We	have	a firm	of	private	detectives	and	we	have	the	whole	area	loaded.	I’ll	tell	you	more when	we	get	in	the	car.”
																Clemenza	was	driving,	Michael	and	Hagen	sat	in	the	back.	Michael’s head	throbbed.	“So	what	the	hell	really	happened	last	night,	did	you	guys	ever find	out?”
																Hagen	spoke	quietly.	“Sonny	has	an	inside	man,	that	Detective	Phillips who	tried	to	protect	you.	He	gave	us	the	scoop.	The	police	captain,	McCluskey, is	a	guy	who’s	been	on	the	take	very	heavy	ever	since	he’s	been	a	patrolman. Our	Family	has	paid	him	quite	a	bit.	And	he’s	greedy	and	untrustworthy	to	do business	with.	But	Sollozzo	must	have	paid	him	a	big	price.	McCluskey	had	all Tessio’s	men	around	and	in	the	hospital	arrested	right	after	visiting	hours.	It didn’t	help	that	some	of	them	were	carrying	guns.	Then	McCluskey	pulled	the official	guard	detectives	off	the	Don’s	door.	Claimed	he	needed	them	and	that some	other	cops	were	supposed	to	go	over	and	take	their	place	but	they	got	their assignments	bollixed.	Baloney.	He	was	paid	off	to	set	the	Don	up.	And	Phillips said	he’s	the	kind	of	guy	who’ll	try	it	again.	Sollozzo	must	have	given	him	a fortune	for	openers	and	promised	him	the	moon	to	come.”
																“Was	my	getting	hurt	in	the	papers?”
																“No,”	Hagen	said.	“We	kept	that	quiet.	Nobody	wants	that	known.	Not the	cops.	Not	us.”
																“Good,”	Michael	said.	“Did	that	boy	Enzo	get	away?”
																“Yeah,”	Hagen	said.	“He	was	smarter	than	you.	When	the	cops	came he	disappeared.	He	claims	he	stuck	with	you	while	Sollozzo’s	car	went	by.	Is that	true?”
																“Yeah,”	Michael	said.	“He’s	a	good	kid.”
																“He’ll	be	taken	care	of,”	Hagen	said.	“You	feeling	OK?”	His	face	was concerned.	“You	look	lousy.”
																“I’m	OK,”	Michael	said.	“What	was	that	police	captain’s	name?”
