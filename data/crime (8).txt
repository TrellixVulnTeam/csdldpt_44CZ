men	to	be	killed.
																When	Sonny	hung	up	the	phone	he	said	to	Theresa	Hagen	and Michael,	“Can	you	two	wait	outside?	I	got	some	business	with	Tessio	we	have	to finish.”
																Hagen’s	wife	said,	“Was	that	call	about	Tom?”	She	said	it	almost truculently	but	she	was	weeping	with	fright.	Sonny	put	his	arm	around	her	and led	her	to	the	door.	“I	swear	he’s	going	to	be	OK,”	he	said.	“Wait	in	the	living room.	I’ll	come	out	as	soon	as	I	hear	something.”	He	shut	the	door	behind	her. Michael	had	sat	down	in	one	of	the	big	leather	armchairs.	Sonny	gave	him	a quick	sharp	look	and	then	went	to	sit	down	behind	the	desk.
																“You	hang	around	me,	Mike,”	he	said,	“you’re	gonna	hear	things	you don’t	wanta	hear.”
																Michael	lit	a	cigarette.	“I	can	help	out,”	he	said.
																“No,	you	can’t,”	Sonny	said.	“The	old	man	would	be	sore	as	hell	if	I let	you	get	mixed	up	in	this.”
																Michael	stood	up	and	yelled.	“You	lousy	bastard,	he’s	my	father.	I’m not	supposed	to	help	him?	I	can	help.	I	don’t	have	to	go	out	and	kill	people	but	I can	help.	Stop	treating	me	like	a	kid	brother.	I	was	in	the	war.	I	got	shot, remember?	I	killed	some	Japs.	What	the	hell	do	you	think	I’ll	do	when	you knock	somebody	off?	Faint?”
																Sonny	grinned	at	him.	“Pretty	soon	you’ll	want	me	to	put	up	my dukes.	OK,	stick	around,	you	can	handle	the	phone.”	He	turned	to	Tessio.	“That call	I	just	got	gave	me	dope	we	needed.”	He	turned	to	Michael.	“Somebody	had to	finger	the	old	man.	It	could	have	been	Clemenza,	it	could	have	been	Paulie Gat	to,	who	was	very	conveniently	sick	today.	I	know	the	answer	now,	let’s	see how	smart	you	are,	Mike,	you’re	the	college	boy.	Who	sold	out	to	Sollozzo?”
																Michael	sat	down	again	and	relaxed	back	into	the	leather	armchair.	He thought	everything	over	very	carefully.	Clemenza	was	a	caporegime	in	the
Corleone	Family	structure.	Don	Corleone	had	made	him	a	millionaire	and	they had	been	intimate	friends	for	over	twenty	years.	He	held	one	of	the	most powerful	posts	in	the	organization.	What	could	Clemenza	gain	for	betraying	his Don?	More	money?	He	was	rich	enough	but	then	men	are	always	greedy.	More power?	Revenge	for	some	fancied	insult	or	slight?	That	Hagen	had	been	made the	Consigliere?	Or	perhaps	a	businessman’s	conviction	that	Sollozzo	would win	out?	No,	it	was	impossible	for	Clemenza	to	be	a	traitor,	and	then	Michael thought	sadly	it	was	only	impossible	because	he	didn’t	want	Clemenza	to	die. The	fat	man	had	always	brought	him	gifts	when	he	was	growing	up,	had sometimes	taken	him	on	outings	when	the	Don	had	been	too	busy.	He	could	not believe	that	Clemenza	was	guilty	of	treachery.
																But,	on	the	other	hand,	Sollozzo	would	want	Clemenza	in	his	pocket more	than	any	other	man	in	the	Corleone	Family.
																Michael	thought	about	Paulie	Gat	to.	Paulie	as	yet	had	not	become rich.	He	was	well	thought	of,	his	rise	in	the	organization	was	certain	but	he would	have	to	put	in	his	time	like	everybody	else.	Also	he	would	have	wilder dreams	of	power,	as	the	young	always	do.	It	had	to	be	Paulie.	And	then	Michael remembered	that	in	the	sixth	grade	he	and	Paulie	had	been	in	the	same	class	in school	and	he	didn’t	want	it	to	be	Paulie	either.
																He	shook	his	head.	“Neither	one	of	them,”	he	said.	But	he	said	it	only because	Sonny	had	said	he	had	the	answer.	If	it	had	been	a	vote,	he	would	have voted	Paulie	guilty.
																Sonny	was	smiling	at	him.	“Don’t	worry,”	he	said.	“Clemenza	is	OK. It’s	Paulie.”
																Michael	could	see	that	Tessio	was	relieved.	As	a	fellow	caporegime his	sympathy	would	be	with	Clemenza.	Also	the	present	situation	was	not	so serious	if	treachery	did	not	reach	so	high.	Tessio	said	cautiously,	“Then	I	can send	my	people	home	tomorrow?”
																Sonny	said,	“The	day	after	tomorrow.	I	don’t	want	anybody	to	know about	this	until	then.	Listen,	I	want	to	talk	some	family	business	with	my
brother,	personal.	Wait	out	in	the	living	room,	eh?	We	can	finish	our	list	later. You	and	Clemenza	will	work	together	on	it.”
																“Sure,”	Tessio	said.	He	went	out.
																“How	do	you	know	for	sure	it’s	Paulie?”	Michael	asked.
																Sonny	said,	“We	have	people	in	the	telephone	company	and	they tracked	down	all	of	Paulie’s	phone	calls	in	and	out.	Clemenza’s	too.	On	the	three days	Paulie	was	sick	this	month	he	got	a	call	from	a	street	booth	across	from	the old	man’s	building.	Today	too.	They	were	checking	to	see	if	Paulie	was	coming down	or	somebody	was	being	sent	down	to	take	his	place.	Or	for	some	other reason.	It	doesn’t	matter.”	Sonny	shrugged.	“Thank	God	it	was	Paulie.	We’ll need	Clemenza	bad.”
																Michael	asked	hesitantly,	“Is	it	going	to	be	an	all-out	war?”
																Sonny’s	eyes	were	hard.	“That’s	how	I’m	going	to	play	it	as	soon	as Tom	checks	in.	Until	the	old	man	tells	me	different.”
																Michael	asked,	“So	why	don’t	you	wait	until	the	old	man	can	tell you?”
																Sonny	looked	at	him	curiously.	“How	the	hell	did	you	win	those combat	medals?	We	are	under	the	gun,	man,	we	gotta	fight.	I’m	just	afraid	they won’t	let	Tom	go.”
																Michael	was	surprised	at	this.	“Why	not?”
																Again	Sonny’s	voice	was	patient.	“They	snatched	Tom	because	they figured	the	old	man	was	finished	and	they	could	make	a	deal	with	me	and	Tom would	be	the	sit-down	guy	in	the	preliminary	stages,	carry	the	proposition.	Now with	the	old	man	alive	they	know	I	can’t	make	a	deal	so	Tom’s	no	good	to	them. They	can	turn	him	loose	or	dump	him,	depending	how	Sollozzo	feels.	If	they dump	him,	it	would	be	just	to	show	us	they	really	mean	business,	trying	to
bulldoze	us.”
																Michael	said	quietly,	“What	made	Sollozzo	think	he	could	get	a	deal with	you?”
																Sonny	flushed	and	he	didn’t	answer	for	a	moment.	Then	he	said,	“We had	a	meeting	a	few	months	ago,	Sollozzo	came	to	us	with	a	proposition	on drugs.	The	old	man	turned	him	down.	But	during	the	meeting	I	shot	off	my mouth	a	little,	I	showed	I	wanted	the	deal.	Which	is	absolutely	the	wrong	thing to	do;	if	there’s	one	thing	the	old	man	hammered	into	me	it’s	never	to	do	a	thing like	that,	to	let	other	people	know	there’s	a	split	of	opinion	in	the	Family.	So Sollozzo	figures	he	gets	rid	of	the	old	man,	I	have	to	go	in	with	him	on	the drugs.	With	the	old	man	gone,	the	Family	power	is	cut	at	least	in	half.	I	would	be fighting	for	my	life	anyway	to	keep	all	the	businesses	the	old	man	got	together. Drugs	are	the	coming	thing,	we	should	get	into	it.	And	his	knocking	off	the	old man	is	purely	business,	nothing	personal.	As	a	matter	of	business	I	would	go	in with	him.	Of	course	he	would	never	let	me	get	too	close,	he’d	make	sure	I’d never	get	a	clean	shot	at	him,	just	in	case.	But	he	also	knows	that	once	I	accepted the	deal	the	other	Families	would	never	let	me	start	a	war	a	couple	of	years	later just	for	revenge.	Also,	the	Tattaglia	Family	is	behind	him.”
																“If	they	had	gotten	the	old	man,	what	would	you	have	done?”	Michael asked.
																Sonny	said	very	simply,	“Sollozzo	is	dead	meat.	I	don’t	care	what	it costs.	I	don’t	care	if	we	have	to	fight	all	the	five	families	in	New	York.	The Tattaglia	Family	is	going	to	be	wiped	out.	I	don’t	care	if	we	all	go	down together.”
																Michael	said	softly,	“That’s	not	how	Pop	would	have	played	it.”
																Sonny	made	a	violent	gesture.	“I	know	I’m	not	the	man	he	was.	But I’ll	tell	you	this	and	he’ll	tell	you	too.	When	it	comes	to	real	action	I	can	operate as	good	as	anybody,	short-range.	Sollozzo	knows	that	and	so	do	Clemenza	and Tessio,	I	‘made	my	bones’	when	I	was	nineteen,	the	last	time	the	Family	had	a war,	and	I	was	a	big	help	to	the	old	man.	So	I’m	not	worried	now.	And	our
Family	has	all	the	horses	in	a	deal	like	this.	I	just	wish	we	could	get	contact	with Luca.”
																Michael	asked	curiously,	“Is	Luca	that	tough,	like	they	say?	Is	he	that good?”
																Sonny	nodded.	“He’s	in	a	class	by	himself.	I’m	going	to	send	him	after the	three	Tattaglias.	I’ll	get	Sollozzo	myself.”
																Michael	shifted	uneasily	in	his	chair.	He	looked	at	his	older	brother. He	remembered	Sonny	as	being	sometimes	casually	brutal	but	essentially warmhearted.	A	nice	guy.	It	seemed	unnatural	to	hear	him	talking	this	way,	it was	chilling	to	see	the	list	of	names	he	had	scribbled	down,	men	to	be	executed, as	if	he	were	some	newly	crowned	Roman	Emperor.	He	was	glad	that	he	was	not truly	part	of	all	this,	that	now	his	father	lived	he	did	not	have	to	involve	himself in	vengeance.	He’d	help	out,	answering	the	phone,	running	errands	and messages.	Sonny	and	the	old	man	could	take	care	of	themselves,	especially	with Luca	behind	them.
																At	that	moment	they	heard	a	woman	scream	in	the	living	room.	Oh, Christ,	Michael	thought,	it	sounded	like	Tom’s	wife.	He	rushed	to	the	door	and opened	it.	Everybody	in	the	living	room	was	standing.	And	by	the	sofa	Tom Hagen	was	holding	Theresa	close	to	him,	his	face	embarrassed.	Theresa	was weeping	and	sobbing,	and	Michael	realized	that	the	scream	he	had	heard	had been	her	calling	out	her	husband’s	name	with	joy.	As	he	watched,	Tom	Hagen disentangled	himself	from	his	wife’s	arms	and	lowered	her	back	onto	the	sofa. He	smiled	at	Michael	grimly.	“Glad	to	see	you,	Mike,	really	glad.”	He	strode into	the	office	without	another	look	at	his	still-sobbing	wife.	He	hadn’t	lived with	the	Corleone	Family	ten	years	for	nothing,	Michael	thought	with	a	queer flush	of	pride.	Some	of	the	old	man	had	rubbed	off	on	him,	as	it	had	on	Sonny, and	he	thought,	with	surprise,	even	on	himself.
	
Chapter	5

	
																It	was	nearly	four	o’clock	in	the	morning	as	they	all	sat	in	the	corner room	office--Sonny,	Michael,	Tom	Hagen,	Clemenza	and	Tessio.	Theresa Hagen	had	been	persuaded	to	go	to	her	own	home	next	door.	Paulie	Gatto	was still	waiting	in	the	living	room,	not	knowing	that	Tessio’s	men	had	been instructed	not	to	let	him	leave	or	let	him	out	of	their	sight.
																Tom	Hagen	relayed	the	deal	Sollozzo	offered.	He	told	how	after Sollozzo	had	learned	the	Don	still	lived,	it	was	obvious	that	he	meant	to	kill Hagen.	Hagen	grinned.	“If	I	ever	plead	before	the	Supreme	Court,	I’ll	never plead	better	than	I	did	with	that	goddamn	Turk	tonight.	I	told	him	I’d	talk	the Family	into	the	deal	even	though	the	Don	was	alive.	I	told	him	I	could	wrap	you around	my	finger,	Sonny.	How	we	were	buddies	as	kids;	and	don’t	get	sore,	but	I let	him	get	the	idea	that	maybe	you	weren’t	too	sorry	about	getting	the	old	man’s job,	God	forgive	me.”	He	smiled	apologetically	at	Sonny,	who	made	a	gesture signifying	that	he	understood,	that	it	was	of	no	consequence.
																Michael,	leaning	back	in	his	armchair	with	the	phone	at	his	right	hand, studied	both	men.	When	Hagen	had	entered	the	room	Sonny	had	come	rushing to	embrace	him.	Michael	realized	with	a	faint	twinge	of	jealousy	that	in	many ways	Sonny	and	Tom	Hagen	were	closer	than	he	himself	could	ever	be	to	his own	brother.
																“Let’s	get	down	to	business,”	Sonny	said.	“We	have	to	make	plans. Take	a	look	at	this	list	me	and	Tessio	made	up.	Tessio,	give	Clemenza	your copy.”
																“If	we	make	plans,”	Michael	said,	“Freddie	should	be	here.”
																Sonny	said	grimly,	“Freddie	is	no	use	to	us.	The	doctor	says	he’s	in shock	so	bad	he	has	to	have	complete	rest.	I	don’t	understand	that.	Freddie	was always	a	pretty	tough	guy.	I	guess	seeing	the	old	man	gunned	down	was	hard	on him,	he	always	thought	the	Don	was	God.	He	wasn’t	like	you	and	me,	Mike.”
																Hagen	said	quickly,	“OK,	leave	Freddie	out.	Leave	him	out	of
everything,	absolutely	everything.	Now,	Sonny,	until	this	is	allover	I	think	you should	stay	in	the	house.	I	mean	never	leave	it.	You’re	safe	here.	Don’t underrate	Sollozzo,	he’s	got	to	be	a	pezzonovante,	a	real	.90	caliber.	Is	the hospital	covered?”
																Sonny	nodded.	“The	cops	have	it	locked	in	and	I	got	my	people	there visiting	Pop	all	the	time.	What	do	you	think	of	that	list,	Tom?”
																Hagen	frowned	down	at	the	list	of	names.	“Jesus	Christ,	Sonny,	you’re really	taking	this	personal.	The	Don	would	consider	it	a	purely	business	dispute. Sollozzo	is	the	key.	Get	rid	of	Sollozzo	and	everything	falls	in	line.	You	don’t have	to	go	after	the	Tattaglias.”
																Sonny	looked	at	his	two	caporegimes.	Tessio	shrugged.	“It’s	tricky,” he	said.	Clemenza	didn’t	answer	at	all.
																Sonny	said	to	Clemenza,	“One	thing	we	can	take	care	of	without discussion.	I	don’t	want	Paulie	around	here	anymore.	Make	that	first	on	your list.”	The	fat	caporegime	nodded.
																Hagen	said,	“What	about	Luca?	Sollozzo	didn’t	seem	worried	about Luca.	That	worries	me.	If	Luca	sold	us	out,	we’re	in	real	trouble.	That’s	the	first thing	we	have	to	know.	Has	anybody	been	able	to	get	in	touch	with	him?”
																“No,”	Sonny	said.	“I’ve	been	calling	him	all	night.	Maybe	he’s shacked	up.”
																“No,”	Hagen	said.	“He	never	sleeps	over	with	a	broad.	He	always	goes home	when	he’s	through.	Mike,	keep	ringing	his	number	until	you	get	an answer.”	Michael	dutifully	linded	up	the	phone	and	dialed.	He	could	hear	the phone	ringing	on	the	other	end	but	no	one	answered.	Finally	he	hung	up.	“Keep trying	every	fifteen	minutes,”	Hagen	said.
																Sonny	said	impatiently,	“OK,	Tom	you’re	the	Consigliere,	how	about some	advice?	What	the	hell	do	you	think	we	should	do?”
																Hagen	helped	himself	to	the	whiskey	bottle	on	the	desk.	“We	negotiate with	Sollozzo	until	your	father	is	in	shape	to	take	charge.	We	might	even	make	a deal	if	we	have	to.	When	your	father	gets	out	of	bed	he	can	settle	the	whole business	without	a	fuss	and	all	the	Families	will	go	along	with	him.”
																Sonny	said	angrily,	“You	think	I	can’t	handle	this	guy	Sollozzo?”
																Tom	Hagen	looked	him	directly	in	the	eye.	“Sonny,	sure	you	can outfight	him.	The	Corleone	Family	has	the	power.	You	have	Clemenza	and Tessio	here	and	they	can	muster	a	thousand	men	if	it	comes	to	an	all-out	war. But	at	the	end	there	will	be	a	shambles	over	the	whole	East	Coast	and	all	the other	Families	will	blame	the	Corleones.	We’ll	make	a	lot	of	enemies.	And that’s	something	your	father	never	believed	in.”
																Michael,	watching	Sonny,	thought	he	took	this	well.	But	then	Sonny said	to	Hagen,	“What	if	the	old	man	dies,	what	do	you	advise	then, Consigliere?”
																Hagen	said	quietly,	“I	know	you	won’t	do	it,	but	I	would	advise	you	to make	a	real	deal	with	Sollozzo	on	the	drugs.	Without	your	father’s	political contacts	and	personal	influence	the	Corleone	Family	loses	half	its	strength. Without	your	father,	the	other	New	York	Families	might	wind	up	supporting	the Tattaglias	and	Sollozzo	just	to	make	sure	there	isn’t	a	long	destructive	war.	If your	father	dies,	make	the	deal.	Then	wait	and	see.”
																Sonny	was	white-faced	with	anger.	“That’s	easy	for	you	to	say,	it’s	not your	father	they	killed.”
																Hagen	said	quickly	and	proudly,	“I	was	as	good	a	son	to	him	as	you	or Mike,	maybe	better.	I’m	giving	you	a	professional	opinion.	Personally	I	want	to kill	all	those	bastards.”	The	emotion	in	his	voice	shamed	Sonny,	who	said,	“Oh, Christ,	Tom,	I	didn’t	mean	it	that	way.”	But	he	had,	really.	Blood	was	blood	and nothing	else	was	its	equal.
																Sonny	brooded	for	a	moment	as	the	others	waited	in	embarrassed silence.	Then	he	sighed	and	spoke	quietly.	“OK,	we’ll	sit	tight	until	the	old	man
can	give	us	the	lead.	But,	Tom,	I	want	you	to	stay	inside	the	mall,	too.	Don’t take	any	chances.	Mike,	you	be	careful,	though	I	don’t	think	even	Sollozzo would	bring	personal	family	into	the	war.	Everybody	would	be	against	him	then. But	be	careful.	Tessio,	you	hold	your	people	in	reserve	but	have	them	nosing around	the	city.	Clemenza,	after	you	settle	the	Paulie	Gatto	thing,	you	move	your men	into	the	house	and	the	mall	to	replace	Tessio’s	people.	Tessio,	you	keep your	men	at	the	hospital,	though.	Tom,	start	negotiation	over	the	phone	or	by messenger	with	Sollozzo	and	the	Tattaglias	the	first	thing	in	the	morning.	Mike, tomorrow	you	take	a	couple	of	Clemenza’s	people	and	go	to	Luca’s	house	and wait	for	him	to	show	up	or	find	out	where	the	hell	he	is.	That	crazy	bastard might	be	going	after	Sollozzo	right	now	if	he’s	heard	the	news.	I	can’t	believe he’d	ever	go	against	his	Don,	no	matter	what	the	Turk	offered	him.”
																Hagen	said	reluctantly,	“Maybe	Mike	shouldn’t	get	mixed	up	in	this	so directly.”
																“Right,”	Sonny	said.	“Forget	that,	Mike.	Anyway	I	need	you	on	the phone	here	in	the	house,	that’s	more	important.”
																Michael	didn’t	say	anything.	He	felt	awkward,	almost	ashamed,	and	he noticed	Clemenza	and	Tessio	with	faces	so	carefully	impassive	that	he	was	sure that	they	were	hiding	their	contempt.	He	picked	up	the	phone	and	dialed	Luca Brasi’s	number	and	kept	the	receiver	to	his	ear	as	it	rang	and	rang.
	
Chapter	6
	
																Peter	Clemenza	slept	badly	that	night.	In	the	morning	he	got	up	early and	made	his	own	breakfast	of	a	glass	of	grappa,	a	thick	slice	of	Genoa	salami with	a	chunk	of	fresh	Italian	bread	that	was	still	delivered	to	his	door	as	in	the old	days.	Then	he	drank	a	great,	plain	china	mug	filled	with	hot	coffee	that	had been	lashed	with	anisette.	But	as	he	padded	about	the	house	in	his	old	bathrobe and	red	felt	slippers	he	pondered	on	the	day’s	work	that	lay	ahead	of	him.	Last
night	Sonny	Corleone	had	made	it	very	clear	that	Paulie	Gatto	was	to	be	taken care	of	immediately.	It	had	to	be	today.
																Clemenza	was	troubled.	Not	because	Gatto	had	been	his	protégé	and had	turned	traitor.	This	did	not	reflect	on	the	caporegime’s	judgment.	After	all, Paulie’s	background	had	been	perfect.	He	came	from	a	Sicilian	family,	he	had grown	up	in	the	same	neighborhood	as	the	Corleone	children,	had	indeed	even gone	to	school	with	one	of	the	sons.	He	had	been	brought	up	through	each	level in	the	proper	manner.	He	had	been	tested	and	not	found	wanting.	And	then	after he	had	“made	his	bones”	he	had	received	a	good	living	from	the	Family,	a percentage	of	an	East	Side	“book”	and	a	union	payroll	slot.	Clemenza	had	not been	unaware	that	Paulie	Gatto	supplemented	his	income	with	free-lance stickups,	strictly	against	the	Family	rules,	but	even	this	was	a	sign	of	the	man’s worth.	The	breaking	of	such	regulations	was	considered	a	sign	of	highspiritedness,	like	that	shown	by	a	fine	racing	horse	fighting	the	reins.
																And	Paulie	had	never	caused	trouble	with	his	stickups.	They	had always	been	meticulously	planned	and	carried	out	with	the	minimum	of	fuss	and trouble,	with	no	one	ever	getting	hurt:	a	three-thousand-dollar	Manhattan garment	center	payroll,	a	small	chinaware	factory	payroll	in	the	slums	of Brooklyn.	After	all,	a	young	man	could	always	use	some	extra	pocket	money.	It was	all	in	the	pattern.	Who	could	ever	foretell	that	Paulie	Gatto	would	turn traitor?
																What	was	troubling	Peter	Clemenza	this	morning	was	an administrative	problem.	The	actual	execution	of	Gatto	was	a	cut-and-dried chore.	The	problem	was,	who	should	the	caporegime	bring	up	from	the	ranks	to replace	Gatto	in	the	Family?	It	was	an	important	promotion,	that	to	“button” man,	one	not	to	be	handed	out	lightly.	The	man	had	to	be	tough	and	he	had	to	be smart.	He	had	to	be	safe,	not	a	person	who	would	talk	to	the	police	if	he	got	in trouble,	one	well	saturated	in	the	Sicilians’	law	of	omerta,	the	law	of	silence. And	then,	what	kind	of	a	living	would	he	receive	for	his	new	duties?	Clemenza had	several	times	spoken	to	the	Don	about	better	rewards	for	the	all-important button	man	who	was	first	in	the	front	line	when	trouble	arose,	but	the	Don	had put	him	off.	If	Paulie	had	been	making	more	money,	he	might	have	been	able	to resist	the	blandishments	of	the	wily	Turk,	Sollozzo.
