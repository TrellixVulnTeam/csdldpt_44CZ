inside,	you	will	make	him	happy.”
																A	nurse	and	a	doctor	came	out	of	Genco	Abbandando’s	private	room. The	doctor	was	a	young	man,	serious-faced	and	with	the	air	of	one	born	to command,	that	is	to	say,	the	air	of	one	who	has	been	immensely	rich	all	his	life. One	of	the	daughters	asked	timidly,	“Dr.	Kennedy,	can	we	go	to	see	him	now?”
																Dr.	Kennedy	looked	over	the	large	group	with	exasperation.	Didn’t these	people	realize	that	the	man	inside	was	dying	and	dying	in	torturous	pain?	It would	be	much	better	if	everyone	let	him	die	in	peace.	“I	think	just	the immediate	family,”	he	said	in	his	exquisitely	polite	voice.	He	was	surprised when	the	wife	and	daughters	turned	to	the	short,	heavy	man	dressed	in	an awkwardly	fitted	tuxedo,	as	if	to	hear	his	decision.
																The	heavy	man	spoke.	There	was	just	the	slightest	trace	of	an	Italian accent	in	his	voice.	“My	dear	doctor,”	said	Don	Corleone,	“is	it	true	he	is dying?”
																“Yes,”	said	Dr.	Kennedy.
																“Then	there	is	nothing	more	for	you	to	do,”	said	Don	Corleone.	“We will	take	up	the	burden.	We	will	comfort	him.	We	will	close	his	eyes.	We	will bury	him	and	weep	at	his	funeral	and	afterwards	we	will	watch	over	his	wife	and daughters.”	At	hearing	things	put	so	bluntly,	forcing	her	to	understand,	Mrs. Abbandando	began	to	weep.
																Dr.	Kennedy	shrugged.	It	was	impossible	to	explain	to	these	peasants. At	the	same	time	he	recognized	the	crude	justice	in	the	man’s	remarks.	His	role was	over.	Still	exquisitely	polite,	he	said,	“Please	wait	for	the	nurse	to	let	you	in, she	has	a	few	necessary	things	to	do	with	the	patient.”	He	walked	away	from them	down	the	corridor,	his	white	coat	flapping.
																The	nurse	went	back	into	the	room	and	they	waited.	Finally	she	came out	again,	holding	the	door	for	them	to	enter.	She	whispered,	“He’s	delirious with	the	pain	and	fever,	try	not	to	excite	him.	And	you	can	stay	only	a	few minutes,	except	for	the	wife.”	She	recognized	Johnny	Fontane	as	he	went	by	her
and	her	eyes	opened	wide.	He	gave	her	a	faint	smile	of	acknowledgment	and	she stared	at	him	with	frank	invitation.	He	filed	her	away	for	future	reference,	then followed	the	others	into	the	sick	man’s	room.
																Genco	Abbandando	had	run	a	long	race	with	death,	and	now, vanquished,	he	lay	exhausted	on	the	raised	bed.	He	was	wasted	away	to	no	more than	a	skeleton,	and	what	had	once	been	vigorous	black	hair	had	turned	into obscene	stringy	wisps.	Don	Corleone	said	cheerily,	“Genco,	dear	friend,	I	have brought	my	sons	to	pay	their	respects,	and	look,	even	Johnny,	all	the	way	from Hollywood.”
																The	dying	man	raised	his	fevered	eyes	gratefully	to	the	Don.	He	let	the young	men	clasp	his	bony	hand	in	their	fleshy	ones.	His	wife	and	daughters ranged	themselves	along	his	bed,	kissing	his	cheek,	taking	his	other	hand	in	turn.
																The	Don	pressed	his	old	friend’s	hand.	He	said	comfortingly,	“Hurry up	and	get	better	and	we’ll	take	a	trip	back	to	Italy	together	to	our	old	village. We’ll	play	boccie	in	front	of	the	wineshop	like	our	fathers	before	us.”
																The	dying	man	shook	his	head.	He	motioned	the	young	men	and	his family	away	from	his	bedside;	with	the	other	bony	claw	he	hung	fast	to	the	Don. He	tried	to	speak.	The	Don	put	his	head	down	and	then	sat	on	the	bedside	chair. Genco	Abbandando	was	babbling	about	their	childhood.	Then	his	coal-black eyes	became	sly.	He	whispered.	The	Don	bent	closer.	The	others	in	the	room were	astonished	to	see	tears	running	down	Don	Corleone’s	face	as	he	shook	his head.	The	quavering	voice	grew	louder,	filling	the	room.	With	a	tortured, superhuman	effort,	Abbandando	lifted	his	head	off	his	pillow,	eyes	unseeing, and	pointed	a	skeletal	forefinger	at	the	Don.	“Godfather,	Godfather,”	he	called out	blindly,	“save	me	from	death,	I	beg	of	you.	My	flesh	is	burning	off	my	bones and	I	can	feel	the	worms	eating	away	my	brain.	Godfather,	cure	me,	you	have the	power,	dry	the	tears	of	my	poor	wife.	In	Corleone	we	played	together	as children	and	now	will	you	let	me	die	when	I	fear	hell	for	my	sins?”
																The	Don	was	silent.	Abbandando	said,	“It	is	your	daughter’s	wedding day,	you	cannot	refuse	me.”
																The	Don	spoke	quietly,	gravely,	to	pierce	through	the	blasphemous delirium.	“Old	friend,”	he	said,	“I	have	no	such	powers.	If	I	did	I	would	be	more merciful	than	God,	believe	me.	But	don’t	fear	death	and	don’t	fear	hell.	I	will have	a	mass	said	for	your	soul	every	night	and	every	morning.	Your	wife	and your	children	will	pray	for	you.	How	can	God	punish	you	with	so	many	pleas	for mercy?”
																The	skeleton	face	took	on	a	cunning	expression	that	was	obscene. Abbandando	said	slyly,	“It’s	been	arranged	then?”
																When	the	Don	answered,	his	voice	was	cold,	without	comfort.	“You blaspheme.	Resign	yourself.”
																Abbandando	fell	back	on	the	pillow.	His	eyes	lost	their	wild	gleam	of hope.	The	nurse	came	back	into	the	room	and	started	shooing	them	out	in	a	very matter-of-fact	way.	The	Don	got	up	but	Abbandando	put	out	his	hand. “Godfather,”	he	said,	“stay	here	with	me	and	help	me	meet	death.	Perhaps	if	He sees	you	near	me	He	will	be	frightened	and	leave	me	in	peace.	Or	perhaps	you can	say	a	word,	pull	a	few	strings,	eh?”	The	dying	man	winked	as	if	he	were mocking	the	Don,	now	not	really	serious.	“You’re	brothers	in	blood,	after	all.” Then,	as	if	fearing	the	Don	would	be	offended,	be	clutched	at	his	hand.	“Stay with	me,	let	me	hold	your	hand.	We’ll	outwit	that	bastard	as	we’ve	outwitted others.	Godfather,	don’t	betray	me.”
																The	Don	motioned	the	other	people	out	of	the	room.	They	left.	He took	the	withered	claw	of	Genco	Abbandando	in	his	own	two	broad	hands. Softly,	reassuringly,	he	comforted	his	friend,	as	they	waited	for	death	together. As	if	the	Don	could	truly	snatch	the	life	of	Genco	Abbandando	back	from	that most	foul	and	criminal	traitor	to	man.
	
																The	wedding	day	of	Connie	Corleone	ended	well	for	her.	Carlo	Rizzi performed	his	duties	as	a	bridegroom	with	skill	and	vigor,	spurred	on	by	the contents	of	the	bride’s	gift	purse	which	totaled	up	to	over	twenty	thousand dollars.	The	bride,	however,	gave	up	her	virginity	with	a	great	deal	more
willingness	than	she	gave	up	her	purse.	For	the	latter,	he	had	to	blacken	one	of her	eyes.
																Lucy	Mancini	waited	in	her	house	for	a	call	from	Sonny	Corleone, sure	that	he	would	ask	her	for	a	date.	Finally	she	called	his	house	and	when	she heard	a	woman’s	voice	answer	the	phone	she	hung	up.	She	had	no	way	of knowing	that	nearly	everyone	at	the	wedding	had	remarked	the	absence	of	her and	Sonny	for	that	fatal	half	hour	and	the	gossip	was	already	spreading	that Santino	Corleone	had	found	another	victim.	That	he	had	“done	the	job”	on	his own	sister’s	maid	of	honor.
																Amerigo	Bonasera	had	a	terrible	nightmare.	In	his	dreams	he	saw	Don Corleone,	in	peaked	cap,	overalls	and	heavy	gloves,	unloading	bullet-riddled corpses	in	front	of	his	funeral	parlor	and	shouting,	“Remember,	Amerigo,	not	a word	to	anyone,	and	bury	them	quickly.”	He	groaned	so	loud	and	long	in	his sleep	that	his	wife	shook	him	awake.	“Eh,	what	a	man	you	are,”	she	grumbled. “To	have	a	nightmare	only	after	a	wedding.”
																Kay	Adams	was	escorted	to	her	New	York	City	hotel	by	Paulie	Gatto and	Clemenza.	The	car	was	large,	luxurious	and	driven	by	Gat	to.	Clemenza	sat in	the	back	seat	and	Kay	was	given	the	front	seat	next	to	the	driver.	She	found both	men	wildly	exotic.	Their	speech	was	movie	Brooklynese	and	they	treated her	with	exaggerated	courtliness.	During	the	ride	she	chatted	casually	with	both men	and	was	surprised	when	they	spoke	of	Michael	with	unmistakable	affection and	respect.	He	had	led	her	to	believe	that	he	was	an	alien	in	his	father’s	world. Now	Clemenza	was	assuring	her	in	his	wheezing	guttural	voice	that	the	“old man”	thought	Mike	was	the	best	of	his	sons,	the	one	who	would	surely	inherit the	family	business.
																“What	business	is	that?”	Kay	asked	in	the	most	natural	way.
																Paulie	Gatto	gave	her	a	quick	glance	as	he	turned	the	wheel.	Behind her	Clemenza	said	in	a	surprised	voice.	“Didn’t	Mike	tell	you?	Mr.	Corleone	is the	biggest	importer	of	Italian	olive	oil	in	the	States.	Now	that	the	war	is	over	the business	could	get	real	rich.	He’ll	need	a	smart	boy	like	Mike.”
																At	the	hotel	Clemenza	insisted	on	coming	to	the	desk	with	her.	When she	protested,	he	said	simply,	“The	boss	said	to	make	sure	you	got	home	OK.	I gotta	do	it.”
																After	she	received	her	room	key	he	walked	her	to	the	elevator	and waited	until	she	got	in.	She	waved	to	him,	smiling,	and	was	surprised	at	his genuine	smile	of	pleasure	in	return.	It	was	just	as	well	she	did	not	see	him	go back	to	the	hotel	clerk	and	ask,	“What	name	she	registered	under?”
																The	hotel	clerk	looked	at	Clemenza	coldly.	Clemenza	rolled	the	little green	spitball	he	was	holding	in	his	hand	across	to	the	clerk,	who	picked	it	up and	immediately	said,	“Mr.	and	Mrs.	Michael	Corleone.”
																Back	in	the	car,	Paulie	Gatto	said,	“Nice	dame.”
																Clemenza	grunted.	“Mike	is	doing	the	job	on	her.”	unless,	he	thought, they	were	really	married.	“Pick	me	up	early	in	the	morning,”	he	told	Paulie	Gat to.	“Hagen	got	some	deal	for	us	that	gotta	be	done	right	away.”
	
																It	was	late	Sunday	night	before	Tom	Hagen	could	kiss	his	wife	goodbye	and	drive	out	to	the	airport.	With	his	special	number	one	priority	(a	grateful gift	from	a	Pentagon	staff	general	officer)	he	had	no	trouble	getting	on	a	plane	to Los	Angeles.
																It	had	been	a	busy	but	satisfying	day	for	Tom	Hagen.	Genco Abbandando	had	died	at	three	in	the	morning	and	when	Don	Corleone	returned from	the	hospital,	he	had	informed	Hagen	that	he	was	now	officially	the	new Consigliere	to	the	family.	This	meant	that	Hagen	was	sure	to	become	a	very	rich man,	to	say	nothing	of	power.
																The	Don	had	broken	a	long-standing	tradition.	The	Consigliere	was always	a	full-blooded	Sicilian,	and	the	fact	that	Hagen	had	been	brought	up	as	a member	of	the	Don’s	family	made	no	difference	to	that	tradition.	It	was	a question	of	blood.	Only	a	Sicilian	born	to	the	ways	of	omerta,	the	law	of	silence,
could	be	trusted	in	the	key	post	of	Consigliere.	Between	the	head	of	the	family, Don	Corleone,	who	dictated	policy,	and	the	operating	level	of	men	who	actually carried	out	the	orders	of	the	Don,	there	were	three	layers,	or	buffers.	In	that	way nothing	could	be	traced	to	the	top.	Unless	the	Consigliere	turned	traitor.	That Sunday	morning	Don	Corleone	gave	explicit	instructions	on	what	should	be done	to	the	two	young	men	who	had	beaten	the	daughter	of	Amerigo	Bonasera. But	he	had	given	those	orders	in	private	to	Tom	Hagen.	Later	in	the	day	Hagen had,	also	in	private	without	witnesses,	instructed	Clemenza.	In	turn	Clemenza had	told	Paulie	Gatto	to	execute	the	commission.	Paulie	Gatto	would	now muster	the	necessary	manpower	and	execute	the	orders.	Paulie	Gatto	and	his men	would	not	know	why	this	particular	task	was	being	carried	out	or	who	had ordered	it	originally.	Each	link	of	the	chain	would	have	to	turn	traitor	for	the Don	to	be	involved	and	though	it	had	never	yet	happened,	there	was	always	the possibility.	The	cure	for	that	possibility	also	was	known.	Only	one	link	in	the chain	had	to	disappear.
																The	Consigliere	was	also	what	his	name	implied.	He	was	the counselor	to	the	Don,	his	right-hand	man,	his	auxiliary	brain.	He	was	also	his closest	companion	and	his	closest	friend.	On	important	trips	he	would	drive	the Don’s	car,	at	conferences	he	would	go	out	and	get	the	Don	refreshments,	coffee and	sandwiches,	fresh	cigars.	He	would	know	everything	the	Don	knew	or nearly	everything,	all	the	cells	of	power.	He	was	the	one	man	in	the	world	who could	bring	the	Don	crashing	down	to	destruction.	But	no	Consigliere	had	ever betrayed	a	Don,	not	in	the	memory	of	any	of	the	powerful	Sicilian	families	who had	established	themselves	in	America.	There	was	no	future	in	it.	And	every Consigliere	knew	that	if	he	kept	the	faith,	he	would	become	rich,	wield	power and	win	respect.	If	misfortune	came,	his	wife	and	children	would	be	sheltered and	cared	for	as	if	he	were	alive	or	free.	If	he	kept	the	faith.
																In	some	matters	the	Consigliere	had	to	act	for	his	Don	in	a	more	open way	and	yet	not	involve	his	principal.	Hagen	was	flying	to	California	on	just such	a	matter.	He	realized	that	his	career	as	Consigliere	would	be	seriously affected	by	the	success	or	failure	of	this	mission.	By	family	business	standards whether	Johnny	Fontane	got	his	coveted	part	in	the	war	movie,	or	did	not,	was	a minor	matter.	Far	more	important	was	the	meeting	Hagen	had	set	up	with	Virgil Sollozzo	the	following	Friday.	But	Hagen	knew	that	to	the	Don,	both	were	of equal	importance,	which	settled	the	matter	for	any	good	Consigliere.
																The	piston	plane	shook	Tom	Hagen’s	already	nervous	insides	and	he ordered	a	martini	from	the	hostess	to	quiet	them.	Both	the	Don	and	Johnny	had briefed	him	on	the	character	of	the	movie	producer,	Jack	Woltz.	From everything	that	Johnny	said,	Hagen	knew	he	would	never	be	able	to	persuade Woltz.	But	he	also	had	no	doubt	whatsoever	that	the	Don	would	keep	his promise	to	Johnny.	His	own	role	was	that	of	negotiator	and	contact.
																Lying	back	in	his	seat,	Hagen	went	over	all	the	information	given	to him	that	day.	Jack	Woltz	was	one	of	the	three	most	important	movie	producers in	Hollywood,	owner	of	his	own	studio	with	dozens	of	stars	under	contract.	He was	on	the	President	of	the	United	States’	Advisory	Council	for	War Information,	Cinematic	Division,	which	meant	simply	that	he	helped	make propaganda	movies.	He	had	had	dinner	at	the	White	House.	He	had	entertained J.	Edgar	Hoover	in	his	Hollywood	home.	But	none	of	this	was	as	impressive	as	it sounded.	They	were	all	official	relationships.	Woltz	didn’t	have	any	personal political	power,	mainly	because	he	was	an	extreme	reactionary,	partly	because he	was	a	megalomaniac	who	loved	to	wield	power	wildly	without	regard	to	the fact	that	by	so	doing	legions	of	enemies	sprang	up	out	of	the	ground.
																Hagen	sighed.	There	would	be	no	way	to	“handle”	Jack	Woltz.	He opened	his	briefcase	and	tried	to	get	some	paper	work	done,	but	he	was	too	tired. He	ordered	another	martini	and	reflected	on	his	life.	He	had	no	regrets,	indeed	he felt	that	he	had	been	extremely	lucky.	Whatever	the	reason,	the	course	he	had chosen	ten	years	ago	had	proved	to	be	right	for	him.	He	was	successful,	he	was as	happy	as	any	grown	man	could	reasonably	expect,	and	he	found	life interesting.
																Tom	Hagen	was	thirty-five	years	old,	a	tall	crew-cut	man,	very slender,	very	ordinary-looking.	He	was	a	lawyer	but	did	not	do	the	actual detailed	legal	work	for	the	Corleone	family	business	though	he	had	practiced	law for	three	years	after	passing	the	bar	exam.
																At	the	age	of	eleven	he	had	been	a	playmate	of	eleven-year-old	Sonny Corleone.	Hagen’s	mother	had	gone	blind	and	then	died	during	his	eleventh year.	Hagen’s	father,	a	heavy	drinker,	had	become	a	hopeless	drunkard.	A hardworking	carpenter,	he	had	never	done	a	dishonest	thing	in	his	life.	But	his
drinking	destroyed	his	family	and	finally	killed	him.	Tom	Hagen	was	left	an orphan	who	wandered	the	streets	and	slept	in	hallways.	His	younger	sister	had been	put	in	a	foster	home,	but	in	the	1920’s	the	social	agencies	did	not	follow	up cases	of	eleven-year-old	boys	who	were	so	ungrateful	as	to	run	from	their charity.	Hagen,	too,	had	an	eye	infection.	Neighbors	whispered	that	he	had caught	or	inherited	it	from	his	mother	and	so	therefore	it	could	be	caught	from him.	He	was	shunned.	Sonny	Corleone,	a	warmhearted	and	imperious	elevenyear-old,	had	brought	his	friend	home	and	demanded	that	he	be	taken	in.	Tom Hagen	was	given	a	hot	dish	of	spaghetti	with	oily	rich	tomato	sauce,	the	taste	of which	he	had	never	forgotten,	and	then	given	a	metal	folding	bed	to	sleep	on.
																In	the	most	natural	way,	without	a	word	being	spoken	or	the	matter discussed	in	any	fashion,	Don	Corleone	had	permitted	the	boy	to	stay	in	his household.	Don	Corleone	himself	took	the	boy	to	a	special	doctor	and	had	his eye	infection	cured.	He	sent	him	to	college	and	law	school.	In	all	this	the	Don acted	not	as	a	father	but	rather	as	a	guardian.	There	was	no	show	of	affection	but oddly	enough	the	Don	treated	Hagen	more	courteously	than	his	own	sons,	did not	impose	a	parental	will	upon	him.	It	was	the	boy’s	decision	to	go	to	law school	after	college.	He	had	heard/Don	Corleone	say	once,	“	A	lawyer	with	his briefcase	can	steal	more	than	a	hundred	men	with	guns.”	Meanwhile,	much	to the	annoyance	of	their	father,	Sonny	and	Freddie	insisted	on	going	into	the family	business	after	graduation	from	high	school.	Only	Michael	had	gone	on	to college,	and	he	had	enlisted	in	the	Marines	the	day	after	Pearl	Harbor.
																After	he	passed	the	bar	exam,	Hagen	married	to	start	his	own	family. The	bride	was	a	young	Italian	girl	from	New	Jersey,	rare	at	that	time	for	being	a college	graduate.	After	the	wedding,	which	was	of	course	held	in	the	home	of Don	Corleone,	the	Don	offered	to	support	Hagen	in	any	undertaking	he	desired, to	send	him	law	clients;	furnish	his	office,	start	him	in	real	estate..
																Tom	Hagen	had	bowed	his	head	and	said	to	the	Don,	“I	would	like	to work	for	you.”
																The	Don	was	surprised,	yet	pleased.	“You	know	who	I	am?”	he	asked.
																Hagen	nodded.	He	hadn’t	really	known	the	extent	of	the	Don’s	power,
not	then.	He	did	not	really	know	in	the	ten	years	that	followed	until	he	was	made the	acting	Consigliere	after	Genco	Abbandando	became	ill.	But	he	nodded	and met	the	Don’s	eyes	with	his	own.	“I	would	work	for	you	like	your	sons,”	Hagen said,	meaning	with	complete	loyalty,	with	complete	acceptance	of	the	Don’s parental	divinity.	The	Don,	with	that	understanding	which	was	even	then building	the	legend	of	his	greatness,	showed	the	young	man	the	first	mark	of fatherly	affection	since	he	had	come	into	his	household.	He	took	Hagen	into	his arms	for	a	quick	embrace	and	afterward	treated	him	more	like	a	true	son,	though he	would	sometimes	say,	“Tom,	never	forget	your	parents,”	as	if	he	were reminding	himself	as	well	as	Hagen.
																There	was	no	chance	that	Hagen	would	forget.	His	mother	had	been near	moronic	and	slovenly,	so	ridden	by	anemia	she	could	not	feel	affection	for her	children	or	make	a	pretense	of	it.	His	father	Hagen	had	hated.	His	mother’s blindness	before	she	died	had	terrified	him	and	his	own	eye	infection	had	been	a stroke	of	doom.	He	had	been	sure	he	would	go	blind.	When	his	father	died,	Tom Hagen’s	eleven-year-old	mind	had	snapped	in	a	curious	way.	He	had	roamed	the streets	like	an	animal	waiting	for	death	until	the	fateful	day	Sonny	found	him sleeping	in	the	back	of	a	hallway	and	brought	him	to	his	home.	What	had happened	afterward	was	a	miracle.	But	for	years	Hagen	had	had	nightmares, dreaming	he	had	grown	to	manhood	blind,	tapping	a	white	cane,	his	blind children	behind	him	tap-tapping	with	their	little	white	canes	as	they	begged	in the	streets.	Some	mornings	when	he	woke	the	face	of	Don	Corleone	was imprinted	on	his	brain	in	that	first	conscious	moment	and	he	would	feel	safe.
																But	the	Don	had	insisted	that	he	put	in	three	years	of	general	law practice	in	addition	to	his	duties	for	the	family	business.	This	experience	had proved	invaluable	later	on,	and	also	removed	any	doubts	in	Hagen’s	mind	about working	for	Don	Corleone.	He	had	then	spent	two	years	of	training	in	the	offices of	a	top	firm	of	criminal	lawyers	in	which	the	Don	had	some	influence.	It	was apparent	to	everyone	that	he	had	a	flair	for	this	branch	of	the	law.	He	did	well and	when	he	went	into	the	full-time	service	of	the	family	business,	Don Corleone	had	not	been	able	to	reproach	him	once	in	the	six	years	that	followed.
																When	he	had	been	made	the	acting	Consigliere,	the	other	powerful Sicilian	families	referred	contemptuously	to	the	Corleone	family	as	the	“Irish
gang.”	This	had	amused	Hagen.	It	had	also	taught	him	that	he	could	never	hope to	succeed	the	Don	as	the	head	of	the	family	business.	But	he	was	content.	That had	never	been	his	goal,	such	an	ambition	would	have	been	a	“disrespect”	to	his benefactor	and	his	benefactor’s	blood	family.
	
																It	was	still	dark	when	the	plane	landed	in	Los	Angeles.	Hagen	checked into	his	hotel,	showered	and	shaved,	and	watched	dawn	come	over	the	city.	He ordered	breakfast	and	newspapers	to	be	sent	up	to	his	room	and	relaxed	until	it was	time	for	his	ten	A.M.	appointment	with	Jack	Woltz.	The	appointment	had been	surprisingly	easy	to	make.
																The	day	before,	Hagen	had	called	the	most	powerful	man	in	the	movie labor	unions,	a	man	named	Billy	Goff.	Acting	on	instructions	from	Don Corleone,	Hagen	had	told	Goff	to	arrange	an	appointment	on	the	next	day	for Hagen	to	call	on	d	ex	Woltz,	that	he	should	hint	to	Woltz	that	if	Hagen	was	not made	happy	by	the	results	of	the	interview,	there	could	be	a	labor	strike	at	the movie	studio.	An	hour	later	Hagen	received	a	call	from	Goff.	The	appointment would	be	at	ten	A.M.	Woltz	had	gotten	the	message	about	the	possible	labor strike	but	hadn’t	seemed	too	impressed,	Goff	said.	He	added,	“If	it	really	comes down	to	that,	I	gotta	talk	to	the	Don	myself.”
																“If	it	comes	to	that	he’ll	talk	to	you,”	Hagen	said.	By	saying	this	he avoided	making	any	promises.	He	was	not	surprised	that	Goff	was	so	agreeable to	the	Don’s	wishes.	The	family	empire,	technically,	did	not	extend	beyond	the New	York	area	but	Don	Corleone	had	first	become	strong	by	helping	labor leaders.	Many	of	them	still	owed	him	debts	of	friendship.
																But	the	ten	A.M.	appointment	was	a	bad	sign.	It	meant	that	he	would be	first	on	the	appointment	list,	that	he	would	not	be	invited	to	lunch.	It	meant that	Woltz	held	him	in	small	worth.	Goff	had	not	been	threatening	enough, probably	because	Woltz	had	him	on	his	graft	payroll.	And	sometimes	the	Don’s success	in	keeping	himself	out	of	the	limelight	worked	to	the	disadvantage	of	the family	business,	in	that	his	name	did	not	mean	anything	to	outside	circles.
